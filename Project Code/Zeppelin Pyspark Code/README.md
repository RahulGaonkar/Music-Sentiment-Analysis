# Project's Zeppelin PySpark Code Import Instructions:
1. Music Mood Analysis 1, Music Mood Analysis 2 and Music Mood Analysis 3 files are the different approaches we tried with all possible combinations of features to check which one gives better accuracy while training the ML model.
2. You can import all the three JSON files namely Music Mood Analysis 1.json, Music Mood Analysis 2.json and Music Mood Analysis 3.json in your Zeppelin notebook to see the Pyspark code for this project.
3. The Gradient Boosting ML Model (with Binary Classification Evaluator) that we finalized as the best Model giving an accuracy of 70% is present in the  Music Mood Analysis 1.json file.
