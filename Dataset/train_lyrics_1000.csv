TRAAAAW128F429D538.h5,Casual,I Didn't Mean To,"Verse One:

Alright I might
Have had a little glare when I stared at ya ho
But I didn't know she was like that
She stared right back
My niggas warnin me that she was comin on to me
I react like a mack do I act cool
Just to test her cause I ain't no jester
I suggest her and her friend be outtie
Cause I don't want to make my pals get rowdy
And doubt me our friendship
But when lips touch
I go crazy in the clutch
Sorta like schitzo I forgets my bros and pals over gals
I didn't mean to but when you fiend you do
Strange things for the denim no matter who's in em
Grab a flooze then I'm in traffic
Don't laugh it might be your girl that I'm talkin about
I didn't mean to

Chorus: Repeat 2X

It ain't my fault that your girl got caught
It ain't my fault that your girl got caught (I didn't mean to)

Verse Two:

Another incident when I went
Way beyond what I should of done
John should of stopped before them drawers dropped
But I didn't ain't no quittin
Really didn't care who's girl I was hittin
I admit skinz ain't a reason to lose friends
But then again I didn't know, sorry
Accept apologies and live on
Are we goin hold grudges well oh fudge
Its a new year and I do fear
Ya actions ya actin shy
I mean ya need to be smackin
That hoe
Instead of tryin to front on me ya know
Thats exactly how I'm goin to be ya know
I run my game on any G ya know
Cause we the most entertainin
I meant to blame women
For makin me do what the Ak seem to
When you call I screen you
I didn't mean to

Chorus


Verse Three:

Why do fools be schememin dreamin
Actin like demons
Niggas don't give a fuck
Because they beat shit
To many girls front cute
When they want loot
They tell lies the swell guys
Can peep it and thats weak shit
Thats why I run game on every freak I get
Born in Oakland grew up pumpin Too Short
I know the rules on the flooze so who's short
I once had a ho who smoked blunts yo
She tried to get me so I looked at the front door
And now shes not with me so forget it
But every once in a while I'll hit it
And it happened to be your girl
I didn't mean to and I been through
Your relationship and I hate dumb dips
But I really can't trip when they ride my tip
I didn't mean to

Every girl is a something girl
Every girl is a something girl
Every girl is a something girl
She's got something
Every girl is a something girl
Every girl has a somehing smile
Every girl is a something girl
For a while
If I had three wishes I know mine
I would not ask the stars to shine
I wouldn't ask for gems or pearls
I'd ask for the something girls
Every girl is a something girl
From the whites of her eyes
To the tip of a curl
Every girl sends a something boy
With that something
When this old world won't treat you right
You're not feeling yourself tonight
Think of someone you can do
Relax and let that something through
Every girl is a something girl
She's got she's got something",Rock,happy,1982

And now I walk away from it, it's better done secret
I never mouthed those words away, I wouldn't cause concern
Die in a crossfire runaway none of this exists
Someone is killing me

Turn him away, lay over there
His limb is red, I have all clear
Settle the wave I'm on my way
Dreaming of red, memories are worst

I feel abrasive worn and tired, don't think I could win
Take me to a place I adore and then seal me in
I'm not the one I swear I'm not, no matter how I felt
Die in a crossfire runaway, face the ash again
Someone is killing me",Rock,sad,2007

TRAABLR128F423B7E3.h5,Blue Rodeo,Floating,"Lead Vocal by Greg

Well, these late night conversations
Leave a strange taste,
Like french cigarettes.
And these coloured drinks
that you keep on throwin' at me
Just keep on reminding me
I came to forget.

So now every night
You insist on reminding me
Of my lost possibilities
And the stains on the wall.
Well, I don't mean to complain
But it hurts just the same.
And now both of us know
The leaves will fall on their own.

Just throw me a line
That's all that I ask
Well, it's sink or swim and I'm goin' fast
I need love and it's you
And I feel like William Holden floating in a pool.

Yea, you tell me
Life is for living
It's best in the giving
But it's so hard to be free.
Still I do my best
But you refuse my gift
And now all that we share
Is a collection of tears.

Just throw me a line
That's all that I ask
Well, it's sink or swim and I'm going fast
I need love and it's you
And I feel like William Holden floating in a pool.

Right now I'm alive, I'm feelin' well

So I'll keep daydreaming away
Who knows, maybe someday it will all come true

for every living thing under the sun

Rest your head and shut your eyes
Empty ambition blankets the sky...
I'm thinking 'bout another world

Tonight
So drop the gown the game's over just push your face into the fight and it breaks my heart like dancing up all night ride so high we both start thinking 'bout another world tonight
And it feels so wrong like nothing we've ever...
Felt before

The stranger's candy takes you where you ought to be
In broken alleys, in the back of every street
Close your eyes tonight
Baby you can have it
Baby you can have it

Ooh baby gnaw me
Down to the bone
Soon you'll find I'm never gonna take you back home
Well there's so much you never told me
And there's not much I want to know
'cause your pretty face will do just fine
You'll be the star...

Of my every last show
Let's go for a long ride I'll show you places you won't ever want to leave

The stranger's candy takes you where you ought to be
In broken alleys, in the back of every street

Ran off the track yes once again, the vibe is sending
So far from where I might have been, this message pending

We're missing in action living in a time when it's in fashion
To be gun flashing, blasting that's why we ain't lasting
All fastened, strapped ready for rivals harassing
Looking over your shoulder ducking cars that are passing
In my rumbo you hear that latin lingo
Guns shoot through at pachucos fuckin? sickos
With four nickels nobody walks around single
Get caught slipping they'll pull your card from a window
It's that simple locals get gaffled by barrio locos
Steal their spanish grease making them shed a tear like willie bobo
Over dollars, chains and rings things that are worth poco
A coco's out there stealing 'cause they're fiending for perico
A head crack will strike and attack for a sack
Pawn or sell your shit to buy a rock and bring that high back
That's why I strap it's my defense against those
Who are committing defense randomly becoming foes?
Shit is survival of fittest testing who's biggest and realest on the street
Feel this beware of killers, stealers and dealers
Rebel guerillas striking on policemen who give us
Hard times in the city where no love is with us

Ain't no love
Ain't no love
In the city?

stone by stone
dismantle the will of a man
strip his flesh and bone

Reach out your hand
the moment comes
blade catches the light of your eyes
the man slowly comes undone

Nobody noticed
no one saw a thing
all turned a blind eye to the fallen
and the bad luck he brings

You wake in the morning after
the sky's a color that you can't see
friends have fallen by the wayside
why isn't anyone talking to me
get those funny looks in the market
people you loved just stare
wander on with your hands in your pockets
even your girlfriend don't care

They've all come to watch the emperor
They've all come to watch the emperor
They've all come to watch the emperor

To watch the emperor fall

One part truth
three parts deceit
two parts shit that you made up
add passion for heat

Did ya hear he said this
can you believe he done that
can you believe the nerve of the man

stare at the changes in the reflection

As I knelt to pray
I did not see the crevice yawn, no

At night I feel the end it is at hand
My pistol going crazy in my hand

Saafir:You know they don't got the motherfuckin' perseverance cause they
ain't have it hold up though. I gotta go and do this man.

Verse 1:
You can hear the ambition mobbin' in my po position
The intention is to come up
Do your grindin' pay the boss before you floss
And don't lose your mind and find discipline'
And stackin' your scratch
So it don't come up missin' in
As you're askin' the Lord for guidance
While you ridin'
Stickin' and movin' slidin'
In and out the game
Unless you realize you're sprung before you legalize your funds
All you track hustlers that was made for the corner
Dodgin' the coroner's office
I'm tossin' this at you
Now on some sermon type shit
I'm burnin' and I gotta write this
The mic got me ballin'
Shot callin'
It's the murk one like that
Sit back but not in starship
So I don't tarnish or rust
When I'm bustin' on the next jerk
Who swears he's ballin' but can't network
You better off with sexwork
The way you fucked in the game
It's a shame
I'm aimin' at the bathroom stall on all of y'all
With the H.J.s deflecting these hate rays
Until the sun falls
You acquired a dream
Crawl before you ball

Hook: (x2)
What you thought?
You was just gonna ball on the spot?
Let's be real
You gotta stack dollar bills before you get a mil
Gotta handle business before you choose to chill or you fall
Crawl before you ball

Verse 2:
All you pompous ass marks in Babylon yawnin'
Becomin' another nigga spawnin'
>From the trenches
The stench is unknown
I've been crawlin' like a two toed
Chameleon for so long
Writing these songs and ridin' these thongs
With bracelets on they ankle bone
That's anxious to moan
Like Neena Samone
Have a trick
Sickin' thinkin'
That we know it's on
You better crawl before you ball man
Before you fall man
Keep ya hoes off your payroll
Unless they crawl with you
And you know they all with you
And even then they won't fall with you
I'm like fuck 'em
I got to
It's a new sheriff in town his name is Reggie Mamoo
Ya hear?
More like Saafir
On a crawl
By watch how daddy ball
I'm all ears and all eyes
Recognize
I'm crawlin'

Bridge: (x2)
Baby baby let me kick my all to y'all
You gotta crawl before you ball
I've seen so many many soldiers fall
They didn't know you had to crawl before you ball

Verse 3:
You see gotta put in major work in at first
Before you burst
Crawl before you ball but never lose your thirst
When you ballin'
Or you gonna end up broke and butt naked with no garments on
While I'm makin' more cheese than Parmesian
Learn game at a fast rate
Apply it to my walk then stalk
I won't fall off cause I'm a put in that work
And I'm a stick to that plan
Now I'm a stay down with my folleys
The team then turn and brace God gave green
Going, going till I'm gone
I'm ballin'

I need what keeps me warm inside

Stares from the mirror on the wall
You think you know my problems
I think that you don't know my at all

I don't believe I suffer

And I don't believe that I should kneel and hang my head in shame

Strapped on behind my back

Down in the hole where I belong
And when this fight is over
You will stay right here and I will be gone

To God up in heaven you'll get it I hope

She was crossing the street to the box o'er the way 
And when she stepped out never looked either way 
A big auto hit her and sped away fast

The trees are growing restless
They feel the season change
Their fruit has putrefied
Forbidden once and bound to die
The thread of life lies severed
On the brink of paradise

Grinning winds of hate unfurled
Towers tall that grip the sun
Talons stretch 'neath her veil
Reclamation, our time has come
Our time has come

Autumn spreads its golden wings
And lays the path for those unseen
A tangled web of evil spun at last
Winter spawn from barren thighs
To readdress, to slay the blind
And throw the reins untethered to the skies

They pray to the full moon rising
Diana moving with such infinite grace
Wrapped alone in a blanket of nightfall
How many secrets can they read by your face?

Will they know of majesty
Of beauty held in dream-dead sleep
And scarlet seas that bleed the frozen shores?
Will their God of bridled love
Assuage our rule from planes above
Or shrink in fear from chaos roused for war?

War!

Wrest askew the nails
That have held you, lurking deep
September prayers are waning
Burn the shrines of fettered sheep
Spearhead the insurrection
Of a world that seeks no end

Again

To the comfort of your kin
Stain the milky sunset red
And let the others

Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
Next year all our troubles
Will be out of sight

Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay
From now on our troubles
Will be miles away

Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Will be near to us once more

Someday soon we all will be together
If the fates allow
Until then we'll have to muddle through somehow
So have yourself",Pop,happy,2005

I've been waiting so very long for you to say it to me
Say it to me
I'd be skating
Skating on thin ice if I don't agree(-e-e-eee)

I know that you're the one for me
But it took me by surprise
And if I say it back to you
I can't look you in the eye
But I don't want to lose you
And I don't want to confuse you
I guess that this my cue to give you my reply

And you killed it
You killed it
You killed it with I love you

And you killed it
You killed it
You killed it with I love you

And you killed it with I love you
What am I supposed to say back to you
And you killed it with I love you, with I love you

I know it's only
Only three little words that I seem to be so scared of
I'm so scared of
So please show me
How to get these words off the tip of my tongue and out of my mind.
I know that you're the one for me but it took me by surprise
But if I say it back to you
I can't look you in the eye
But I don't want to lose you
And I don't want to confuse you

Three little words running round in my head
There's no one else that I'd rather be next to

It started with a low light
Next thing I knew they ripped me from my bed
And then they took my blood type
They left a strange impression in my head

You know that I was hoping
That I could leave this star-crossed world behind
But when they cut me open
I guess I changed my mind

And you know I might have just flown
Too far from the floor this time
'Cause they're calling me by my name

And they're zipping white light beams
Disregarding bombs and satellites
And that was the turning point
That was one lonely night

The star maker says it ain't so bad
The dream maker's gonna make you mad
The spaceman says, ""Everybody look down.
It's all in your mind.""

Well, now I'm back at home and
I'm looking forward to this life I live
You know it's gonna haunt me
So hesitation to this life I give

You think you might cross over
You're caught between the devil and the deep blue sea
You better look it over
Before you make that leap

And you know I'm fine
But I hear those voices at night
Sometimes they justify my claim

And the public don't dwell on my transmission
'Cause it wasn't televised
But it was the turning point
Oh, what a lonely night

The star maker says it ain't so bad
The dream maker's gonna make you mad
The spaceman says, ""Everybody look down.
It's all in your mind.""

Verse One:

Who shot ya?
Seperate the weak from the ob-solete
Hard to creep them Brooklyn streets
It's on nigga, fuck all that bickering beef
I can hear sweat trickling down your cheek
Your heartbeat soun like Sasquatch feet
Thundering, shaking the concrete
Finish it, stop, when I foil the plot
Neighbors call the cops said they heard mad shots
Saw me in the drop, three in the corner

Slaughter, electrical tape around your daughter
Old school new school need to learn though
I burn baby burn like Disco Inferno
Burn slow like blunts with llello
Peel more skins than Idaho potato
Niggaz know, the lyrical molestin is takin place
Fuckin with B.I.G. it ain't safe
I make your skin chafe, rashes on the masses
Bumps and bruises, blunts and Landcruisers
Big Poppa smash fools, bash fools
Niggaz mad because I know that Cash Rules

I seen the light excite all the freaks
Stack mad chips, spread love with my peeps
Niggaz wanna creep, got ta watch my back
Think the cognac and indo sack make me slack?
I switches all that, cocksucker G's up
One false move, get Swiss cheesed up
Clip to Tec, respect I demand it
Slip and break the 11th commandment
Thou shalt not fuck with raw C-Poppa
Feel a thousand deaths when I drop ya
I feel for you, like Chaka Khan I'm the don
Pussy when I want Rolex on the arm
You'll die slow but calm
Recognize my face, so there won't be no mistake
So you know where to tell Jake, lame nigga
Brave nigga, turned front page nigga
Puff Daddy flips daily
I smoke the blunts he sips on the Bailey's

And my cock, in the fire position and...

I would have loved you like no other babe
But a poet needs his pain
And sometimes life can be so cruel
It will pick you up and drop you down again

So if you try to love me darling please refrain
I'm still searching for the pieces
Someone else once took away
You know I used to love with all my heart
But how the times they can change.

Oh my baby’s been calling and I want you to know
I'm not letting him down i'm just letting him go
Oh I never wanted to be apart
But I still don’t know if I’m a wounded heart.

I’ve seen a lot of heartache and I’ve walked a lonely road
They say the darkest times before the dawn
But the rooster hasn’t crowed
And when you wake up in the morning
Oh my darling I’ll be gone
 
Oh my baby’s been calling and I want you to know
I'm not letting him down i'm just letting him go
Oh I never wanted to be apart
But I still don’t know if I’m a wounded heart
No I still don’t know if I'm a wounded heart.

So many fools fall in love
And it’s a crying game
It’s a crying shame
That I’m not a fool in love
But I know what I’m feeling 
And my heart is still healing

Oh my baby’s been calling and I want you to know
I'm not letting him down i'm just letting him go
Oh I never wanted to be apart
But I still don’t know if I’m a wounded heart
No I still don’t know if I'm a wounded heart.",Pop,happy,2008
TRAAXUY128F426BA55.h5,Gene Clark,Set You Free This Time,"Clark

The first thing that I heard you say 
When you were standing there 
Set in your way was that you were not blind 
You were sure to make a fool of me 
Cause there was nothing there 
That you could see 
That could go beyond your mind 
Now who's standing at the door 
Remembering the days before 
And asking please be kind 
It isn't how it was set up to be 
But I've set you free this time 

I have never been so far out in front 
That I could ever ask for what I want 
And have it any time 
Knowing this you found a thought for me 
That told you just what I should be 
And there I stood behind 
With all the ones that went before 
And memories that always seems to 
Tear me from my mind 
In front of what it is you seem me to be 
I've set you free this time 

I could never find a chance to choose 
Between a way to win or a thing to lose 
Because there was your stand 
On top of all the love you took 
There was only something 
You can look at lying in your hand 
Now who's wondering what has changed 
And why it can not be arranged 
To have each thing work fine 
It isn't how it was set up to be 
But I'll set you free this time",Rock,sad,1998

You give you love so sweetly
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes
But will you love me tomorrow?

Is this a lasting treasure
Or just a moment's pleasure?
Can I believe the magic of your sighs?
Will you still love me tomorrow?

Tonight with words unspoken
You say that I'm the only one
But will my heart be broken
When the night meets the morning sun?

I'd like to know that your love
Is love I can be sure of
So tell me now, and I won't ask again
Will you still love me tomorrow?

I hope to beg your pardon your town just ain't my garden

So honey kiss goodbye to your bad seed my love is not the kinda love you need
I could stay here with you but I wouldn't play fair
Cause bad seed won't grow just anywhere
And you're looking at the baddest of the bad seed

Fuck man, fuck am I doing man, why man
Why God, why did you have to take her? Fuck..

(Sticky)
Why? Why? Why God why?
Everything I love always seems to die
Answer me, speak to me, I don't hear you
Answer me, motherfucker I ain't scared of you
Is there even a God? Do you even exist?
What I gotta do to speak to you slit my wrists?
I'm talking to a God that I can't see
Can you see me? Can you see me?

(God)
Are you confused my son, and scared?
Let me make things more clear, so you're more aware

(Sticky)
Fuck who was that all this shit is freaking me

(God)
It is I God did you not say you wanted to speak with me?

(Sticky)
Bullshit I am talking to myself, I'm going insane

(God)
You are talking to yourself we are one of the same

(Sticky)
It can't be it must be the drugs I'm high
And if you are then why are we born if we live to die?
Is there life after death? What were we before birth?
Why is this whole earth plagued and cursed?
Is killing a sin is there life in other planets?
Is adultery wrong did you write the ten commandments?

(God)
Excuse me my son, one question at a time
We were never born, and we will never die
In the essence, there Is no such thing as death
How could I write commandments and not have them kept?
The soul is eternal you just change form
Then you come back with a new face on
You can not limit love unless you lack understanding
To answer you yes there is life in other planets
The futures a mystery the past is history
Today is a gift that's why it is called the present
Life is so simple unless you make it confusing
The wise ones stand us and the clever we are using

(Sticky)
Wait - God, there is so much I want to ask you
God, God? Where are you? God I need to talk to you

(Chorus)
If you could talk to God, exactly what would you say?
If you could talk to God, exactly what would you say?
If you could talk to God

(Sticky)
Tell me, are there psychics that can speak telepathically?

(God)
Yes but if you use more than one tenth of the minds capacity

(Sticky)
I can't think I feel life going down the drain
In the streets everywhere I am surround in pain

(God)
Don't think, your thoughts are just that- thoughts
Your feelings will really erase what you been taught
Feelings are the language of the soul the soul is truth
I speak through you to aware the youth

(Sticky)
But why let the suffering go on why not just stop it?

(God)
In order for anything to exist, so much is opposite
How can there be left if there was never right?
How can something know death if it never knew life?
How can you lose, if nobody won?
How can it be dark if there was never a sun?
That which is not grandeur, the soil still blessed
Form must exist for part of themself to manifest

(Sticky)
But I never asked to be born, I hate my life
And if you are God dammit then show me the light
And tell me- what's the meaning of life?

(God)
The process of all life
is an ongoing, never-ending process of recreation of self

(Sticky)
Is God a he or she is there one true religion?

(God)
I'm the Alpha, the Omega, the beginning and ending
We are all one and everything is living

If you could talk to God, exactly what would you say?

Tonight...
The stars are aligned and the planets colliding
And the plan is arriving and she's out there smiling
The fear is upon us, the skies tried to warn us
Your parents are goners, no children to mourn
It's driving me crazy, this war is my lady
These bombs are our babies and God is amazing
The tick of the timer, the slip of your rival
The pimps and the rise of your pulse, where you'll find her
Hey hey 

(Chorus - Matthew Santos)
Death is on the tip of her tongue
And danger's at the tip of her fingers
Streets are on fire tonight
Death is on the tip of her tongue
And danger's at the tip of her fingers
Streets are on fire tonight

(Verse One - Lupe Fiasco)
Disease, the virus is spreadin' in all directions
No safe zone, no cure and no protection
No symptoms to find, the signs of an infection
No vaccines, remedies and no corrections
Quarantine your dreams and sever all connections
Don't let 'em in not a friend, not a reflection
Everybody's got it and wants you to have it next and
Don't accept 'em if you want to stay as an exception
No pill can heal the ill of this
Sickness some are still in doubt of its existence
Some call it forgiveness and some call it the vengeance
Some say it's an exit, some say it's an entrance
The poor say the rich have the cure
The rich say the poor are the source
Revolutionaries say it's psychological war 
Invented by the press just to have something to report
Some say the first case came from a maternity ward
Some say a morgue, some say the skies, some say the floors
""Whores,"" say the nuns, ""nuns,"" say the whores
And everybody is sure
The scientists say, ""it only infects the mind""
The little boy said, ""it only infects the girls""
The preacher man said, ""it's gonna kill off the soul""
A bum said, ""it's gonna kill the whole wide world""

(Chorus - Matthew Santos)
Death is on the tip of her tongue
And danger's at the tip of her finger
Streets are on fire tonight
Death is on the tip of her tongue
And danger's at the tip of her finger
Streets are on fire tonight

(Verse Two - Lupe Fiasco)
Believe! Some say the neon signs by the loud speakers repeatin' that everything is fine
A subtle silence to demolish the trouble conscience of accomplished with no knowledge and every freedom denied
Every dream is designed and broadcasted from the masses to the masses from the antennaes on top of the shrines
Was fine and received and planted during the panic and surely it reports back everything in your mind
Everything is lyin', everything is dyin'
Everying is a rule, everything is a crime
Everything was here then everything rewind
New weather burned the feathers off everything flyin'
(And she likes it, and she loves it)
The sadness, the madness, the bad shit, the lavish, the fastest, the clashes
The ashes to ashes, everything intertwined
My femme fatale, my darlin' fallen angel
Once caught her changin' the batteries in her halo
Receipt for wings and everything that she paid for
And the address to the factory where they made those
The scientist said, ""she's already inside my mind""
The little boy said, ""what happened to all the girls?""
The preacher man said, ""she's gonna kill off the soul""
The dope boy said, ""it's the whole wide world""

Prowl the streets of Harajuku (Harajuku, irasshaimase)

Super lovers, tell me where you got yours (at the super lovers store)
Yoji Yamamoto, I'm hanging with the locals
Where the catwalk got its claws, all you fashion know-it-alls
With your underground malls in the world of Harajuku
Putting on a show when you dress up in your clothes
Wild hair color and cell phones your accessories are dead-on

And tear it from our side

Still agreed to disagree
You're connected to the heart
But tonight we'll set you free

So swallow the knife
Carve the way for your pride
Now our hands are tied
The problems lie within
So we pray for night
To start over again

Even now as I write this down
All pretensions disappear
Now our impulses will bite
At the ankles of our fear

So swallow the knife
Carve the way for your pride
Now our hands are tied
The problems lie within
So we pray for night
To start over again

Now our hands are tied
The problems lie within
So we pray for night
To start over again

Words are spoken
Words are broken down

So let's make this night
Be our best mistake
So let's take the time
To wipe the blood away

Now our hands are tied
And the world is caving in

Now our hands are tied
The problems lie within
So we pray for night
To start over again

Whoever is on the front line is gettin' struck first
We mercinaries, fuck turf
Every verse is varied, I bust first
Mayday, Natural Elements controllin' the ship
Rollin' a spliff that'll probably put my soul in a twist
But I remain bonin' a bitch
Got her buck-naked posin' for flicks
Actin' like she was never known for the shit
But I look over the shoulder and see the enemy lookin'
Physically strong but mentally shooken
And for penetentiary bookin's this shit happens
Get orders from my nigga Charlemagne the ship Captain
You sound like a bitch yappin' 
This shit is all Natural to us
Like blowin' endo out the window in the back of the bus
I move back and I bust
Rapid fire
You actin' flyer
Now your family's in black attire
With mad desire
When we caught you in the line of duty
You had it in your mind to shoot me
But every soldier of my kind sollutes me
Now I'm reclinin' with a Lucy
All of my niggas
Smoke it down to the filter
Holdin' a frown with a picture
You smell the smoke when I walk past
You saw blasts
You should've known about the drama in my warpath.

[Chorus]
Mayday Mayday, raise the white flags, time for the payday,
Payday, and it's like that, out shit is World Wide, North, South, East,
And West, put on your shield, lets see who's the best. Repeat 1x

[Verse 2: Mr. Voo-Doo]

You feel the burnin' emission
You squirm in submission
No terms and conditions
Ya'll confirm my suspicions
That ya'll are bitches that resemble Men
Like female Tennis players at Wimbledon
Why you tremblin'?
Shook like the ricter
My voice raise waves
And make ya'll change ways like crooks turnin Muslim
Blast shots burnin' your Bosom
Like bitch cramps
You got lucky your people told you switch camps
Or get damp with plenty led
I'm like a beast with many heads
Sort of like the Predators dreads
I got more arms than Dr. Octavious
Rock your whole block radius
I be the bomb
And I bleed nitrogliceren if you slice my palm
The Don been gone for how long from the rap biz?
Wet more domes than John the baptist
When the gat spits
It ain't over 'till the last man's limbs
Are twisted like he was doin Yoga
In fact my Pistol's longer than the Jokers
I ignite Mag's
Leave your toe wearin' a white tag
So, ya'll niggas better raise the white flag.

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 3: L-Swift]

I swear theres a war in the air in the New York streets
You talk beef?
You had a swollen Melon, now you humble
With loaded weapons, nowhere to run to
We mega high, jet in the sky, droppin' bombs, 
Prepare to crumble as we rock on, 
Beware of the jungle with Anaconda's
Don't puff too much 'cause the enemy smells the Marijuana
We blastin' every object in Combat with honor
So yo, remember the agenda with the plan of action
No retreat, no surrender, keep the cannons blastin'
We blastin' heat 'till each member turns into has-beens
Soldiers bangin', who's click'll get done?
My crew can taste victory at the tip of the tongue
Always prepared physically, take the clip for the gun
And put it in, 'cause when it's on how many niggas'll run?
You said we couldn't win, bullets in ya flesh, cave in your chest
You pullin' for breath, I'm claimin' your death
You shouldn't've stepped, war paint on my chest
Fatigue green and black
And the heat reacts
To make you bleed like hemophiliacs
See me strapped, heavily armed, repetitively
Releasin' caps 'till the enemy's gone, definitely
My people pack metal for me, let a legend be born
I declare war, (What mothafucka!) and it's on.

Transfixed in the desert sands
Take a look at my once empty hand
See the rose that appears so real
Just like the one you saw in your dreams

Those who call me avatar
Know not what they're looking for
They just feed their flames with miracles
Just so you know
If you bathe within my light
You diminish your own might
The illusionist in everyone

As an outcast I faced defeat
Seeking comfort in this painful retreat
Made an oracle against my will
Word spread of miraculous skills

Premonitions call my name
I once doubted them all when they came
Now I embrace it and I'll never be the same

Those who call me avatar
Know not what they're looking for
They just feed their flames with miracles
Just so you know
If you bathe within my light
You diminish your own might
Illusionist in everyone

What I say and what I do was once potential
Sprung from the infinite place that dictates the seen

Know not what they're looking for
They just feed their flames with miracles
Just so you know

You diminish your own might

Where all the angels pray 
And if I close my eyes

Left with our fragile hearts 
Still it's yours that's not beating anymore tonight

Lost were we all and still through this we survived

Our sorrow kills our fears

In darkness we do what we can
In daylight we're oblivion
Our hearts so raw and clear
Are turning away, turning away from here

On water we have walked like the fearless child
What was fastened we've unlocked revealing wondrous wild
And in search for confirmation
We have jumped into the fire
And scrambled with our burning feet through uncontrolled desire

Chorus

There's a well upon the hill from our ancient past
Where an age is standing still holding strong and fast
And there's those that try to tame it
And the carve it into stone
Ah but words cannot extinguish it
However hard they're thrown

Chorus

On Racherie they have worked with their island dreams
By Lough Cleggan they have nourished in the mountain streams
And in searching for acceptance
They have given it away
Only the children of our children
Know the price they had to pay

We're staring at all these lights
And I am going blind

Fill all of the Navy yards
With hard working security guards
'Cause the numbers are wearing off

In Paris on winter nights
Beneath a snowy veil?

Take a simple fateful turn

Seeing through a self that's blinding

Stone the number one deceiver
Multiply the added cost
Easy to become a believer

I'm knowing they want me to catch it in war
Boy boy I seek and destroy any nigga that throw the decoy
See me I'm stacked and ripping shit
Taking off my shirt and breaking them sweats
Tattoos all over my body 7 on the stomach,
Skull on my chest, Nine millimetre in my pocket
Ready to buck on the crowd,
As long as that one little nigga
Sagging and bragging and talking loud
Talking about he bout it bout it

Real niggas don't run they mouth
Real niggas make moves and get rich

For marrow rip through thine spine
If you wanna listen to what I say
Hey gotta pay intuition,
This ain't no free exploit of an exhibit

Here's a nice slug for you

So when my one hit 'em up they fall

Hide your neatly scissored locks

Leave them to the wind and the rain and the snow

Call me up but remember I am no use to you at all

One hand on the banister, a flower in your hair

it's the rap Michael Moore, like Bowling for Columbine

Under heavy surveillance
they might call you a traitor if you want something greater

less than half goes to whatever it's defending

I get smothered in dispair, it's never over, over
Seems I'll never wake from this nightmare,
I let out a silent prayer
That it be over, over

Inside I'm screaming,
Begging pleading no more

I don't know what to do
My heart has been bruised
So sad but it's true
Each beat reminds me of you

It hurts my soul
Cause I can't let go
All these walls are caving in
I can't stop my suffering
I hate to show that I've lost control
Cause i
I keep going right back
To the one thing that I need, oh

I'm about to break
And I can't stop this ache
I'm addicted to your allure
And I'm fiendin' for a cure
Every step I take
Leads to one mistake
I keep going right back
To the one thing that I need, oh

I can't mend
This torn state I'm in
Getting nothing in return
What did I do to deserve
The pain of this slow burn
And everywhere I turn
I keep going right back
To the one thing that I need to walk away from

I say...
I need to get away from ya
I need to walk away from ya
Get away, walk away, walk away

Only thing I need to do is walk away

I need to get away from ya

Giving all your love to just one man

Doin' things that you don't understand
But if you love him, you'll forgive him
Even though he's hard to understand
And if you love him, oh be proud of him
'Cause after all he's just a man.
Stand by your man, give him two arms to cling to
And something warm to come to
When nights are cold and lonely.
Stand by your man, and show the world you love him
Keep giving all the love you can.

TRACMHD128F931FB14.h5,Ensiferum,Hero In A Dream,"A witch read from the palm of his hand
that his life would turn into darkness
and alone he would face all demons
from his past that he tries to forget
An elder king warned of the dangers
that lie in the valleys of north and
his only change was to find his shadow
so he had to set forth

He is the man who travels in the land
of dragons and magic spells
He rides in the winds of fire and snow
and he rules the forest of elves

Slash of the golden sword
a flash in the burning night
Curse of the evil lord
He is fighting for his life for the last time

Oh such beauty in time, but it's just external
He cannot see the truth with his eyes, so he is bound by a lie

The snow starts falling in paradise, as he gazes at the stars
He will be born again in the sky, when the night turns into a dawn

On the way to the ancient castle of time
he will soon be damned by rage
so that his pride could betray him
when it's time to set him free
The tears in his mind had to be pushed aside
as he walked through the gates
He will never die
'cause he is truly a Hero in a Dream",Rock,happy,1999

[Quik] Gotta keep it a secret (woo!)
[Luda] Ay man let me ask you somethin man
[Luda] You ever have one of them days where you felt like
[Luda] you mighta got rid of all the bad seeds in your life?
[Luda] Y'knahmean like you just got your paycheck
[Luda] Paid off a car note or somethin
[Luda] Just jumped out the shower feelin fresh than a muh'fucka
[Luda] Witcha good shoes on, y'knahmtalkinbout?
[Quik] You mean like, paid off a Cadillac car note?
[Luda] Like a Cadillac, like you ready to throw a party
[Luda] Like call e'rybody you know, don't even plan it, just do it
[Quik] In Compton we call that spur of the moment
[Luda] Well let's do it, spur of the moment, whattup?

[Ludacris]
Well you can bring the drinks a little mo' my way
More I say, on another hot sunny Cali-for-nye day
Just touched down, called up my 8-1-8
fo' a date with some other bust downs
And I cruised up the block, car losed up the top
I take the breeze, quick break the trees
Feel good as we flippin through the Robb Repo't
My baby momma ain't trippin on child suppo't

[DJ Quik]
Well my baby momma is, because she see havin kids
as a tool for gettin chips, that's with or without the dip
She told my lawyer she's a nurse but she can't spell school
Quite frankly she's a motherfuckin fool, idiot
Welcome to the city where you might see thangs
Like real threats, fake breasts, negativity hangs
over the city like a puppet string, pullin you up
You think they love you 'til the director yells cut
Now they packin you with ice and zippin you up

[Chorus]
It's on tonight, get licked, get gone tonight
[KJ] And for once, in my life, everything's gonna be, alright
G'd up, my mind is freed up
[KJ] From the day, through the night, everything's gonna be, alright

[DJ Quik]
Now on Arabian Spruce, Seagram's bumpy and juice
We used to bag and then truce, we used to sag and get loose
Not the kind of cats that's out to steal your bag and your jewels
But we check your medication just to see if you cool
You can't be dyin on us, after you live off of hemp
We party hard, like Ludacris Kim and Shock and them
We in that sunshine state where the bomb-ass hen be
And hemp be the beats we flip thee and we pimps thee simply

[Ludacris]
So stay with me, and let's get tipsy
Rememberin the days on the block sippin whiskey
Runnin 'round grinnin, runnin 'round sinnin
Gettin lit, then I wonder why my head kept spinnin
But I'm all grown up now, less throwin up now
Record blowed up, so my hood throwed up
Now let's break loose cause your boy's around
And tonight we gon' celebrate bein alive, riiiiight

[Chorus]

[Ludacris]
It's just one of those days, without a care in the world
You ain't gotta look mean, I know you care for your girl
But she's lookin this way and I'm gonna come get her
Fresh haircut, so I'm feelin quite kipper
Can't nothin go wrong cause my strap's on my back
And if fools wanna scrap then my tool will attack
But forget the click-clack, ain't no need for the steel
Just a straight house party and some meat on the grill

[DJ Quik]
Now if it's Los Angeles, watch a boss handle biz
I'ma put this on my kids, stupid it's an outfit
If you ain't been around the world keep yo' mouth zipped
Or you'll be wonderin where yo' house went
You see I'm not normal and I'm not a homo
I'm mo' apt to shoot a porno with you in cornrows
And call it ""More Hoes: Volume 5, Volume 6""
And show 'em in the back of my truck, at the FreakNic
Trick, what'chu workin with?

Now Gabby got the verbal that'll get your little wifey out her girdle

In a high esteem
I get you drunker than your bourbon, ale, liquor, malt, my assault learned it well
Turn the tables of time with my perception
Building staples of rhyme hear my reflections
""on a little"" life I'm livin in a universe with no beginning to it
So it ain't an ending and at times I get to diggin into infinite subliminably spirited
A nigga with a ""clip and send it rip         ""

Rappers organizations get shut down
Not that I don't wanna see my brothers succeed
But rap its like a sport, I dominate, so follow my lead
I be the G-I-F-T test me hefty left's be gettin' swung

At times when I'm ""  "" they shine you remember

That isn't what it's all about, really now, valid clout

About what it's all about, ain't about foamin out the mouth
Like a walkin tall can of Guinness Stout
""        ""
When the battle cries soundin'
Ding-ding, hit 'em like, bing-bing
Eat 'em like, B-King, yet wit' no seasoning-bee sting
Wich yo girl dressed in a g-string she's swingin'
My way shorty and it sure looks good
I'm cookin up a batch of dopeness like a good cook should
I be the jack of trades, rappers pray
That I don't decapitate, after they cash his ass
Is that an irate? Great!

Hey, hit me wit' that shell shocked rhythm
One time fo' the funky rhymes I say
Two times for the beat and for my DJ
It don't stop

We comin' out (fresh), and we do it (for you)
You know the deal with Blackalicious, we don't play

You know we leave the party wreakin' a disaster
For the new ""millie"", rain like a shower

Rock ya from the top and to the bottom (from the bottom to the top)

So slide to the side and (take it light) and (throw your hands in the air) all night (party people in the place...)
I make 'em suffer, to the fallen mc's I'd be the (quicker pickem upper) (galactic of a nebula)
I'm rappin the spectacular, attackin whack amateurs n' back stabbin salamanders
Creepin while I'm peepin on 'em (party time)

Lying on my back, wheeled under blinding light
Shackled restraints resist my attempted fight
The scalpels hovers over me, the incision is made
Once again they're watching me, no new sensation, just frustration 

They said it was for science
But I'm the human guinea pig
The guinea pig

My sleep has been altered, I open my eyes
The nightmare continues, I see through their lies
The papers keep turning, the tests never ends

Overwhelmed by laughter

Starry skies of stains
Ultimately sorry
Uneducated random strokes of pain

It's a chain going backwards through the veins
Must sew up this wound and run away

I stood up and started moving with a childlike fascination
For those doors that don't have locks and the stairways that were blocked
So I dug through the obstruction, put my fist around the railing

And each step was far apart and far away from steps before it
And the air was getting thinner 'til I couldn't breathe at all
And if I happened to look behind me there were miles and miles of stairs
Enough so I couldn't see the doorway but I knew that it was there

And on the last step I was dizzy 'cause there were stairs in all directions
But I found another door and through the door there was the attic
Without old clothes, without a ceiling, everything had opened wide
Into the jaws of something bigger and suddenly I saw that I was

Upstairs and outside and
Freezing on the roof
Finally it had found me

Crushed beneath those blackened stones
And a roof that fell before the beams were rotten.
See, Saul Darby loved his wife
And he laboured all his life
To provide her with material possessions
And he built for her a home
Of the finest wood and stone
And the building soon became his sole obsession.

Oh it took three hundred days
For the timber to be raised
And the silhouette was seen for miles around
And the gables reached as high
As the eagles in the sky
But it only took one night to bring it down --
When Darby's castle tumbled to the ground.

Though the shared a common bed
There was precious little said
In the moments that were set aside for sleeping.
For his busy dreams were filled
With the rooms he'd yet to build
And he never heard young Helen Darby weeping.
Then one night he heard a sound
As he laid his pencil down
And he traced it to her door and turned the handle,
And the pale light of the moon, 
Through the windows of the room,
Split the shadows where two bodies lay entangled.

Oh it took three hundred days
For the timber to be raised

Why should we even care?

In the great magnetic field
When he traveled time
For the future of mankind

For Iron Man to spread fear
Vengeance from the grave
Kills the people he once saved

He just stares at the world
Planning his vengeance
That he will soon unfurl

Offered unto him.

The orgied frantically.

From the circle on the floor.

When day sinks into darkness.

Living in the village,
Would die one by one by
The curse of the cult.

A witchhunter named Mead,
had burned their leadser at the stake;
Soon he'd regret his deed.

Pain from Devil's we evoke!
Thirst and suffer til he'd choked.
The magic did take over
And the soul did feel the roar.
Incantations were much louder
And more piercing than before.

Evil ones, sources of ills.
Setters of unseen snares,
Death to all pity, all prayers.

No fish, or none of dem candy bars.
No ciggarettes.
Only ganja, and fresh squeezed juice from oranges.

Lentil soup - is- mental fruit

Fresh vegetables with the ital stew.
Sweet yam fries with the green caleoo
Careful how you season and prepare your foods,
cause you dont want to loose - vitamins and minerals 
and that's the jewel-
Life brings.
Life is valuable , so I eat what comes from the ground- It's natural.
Let your food be your medicine. No exceteran.
Strictly herb, generates from the sun.
Cause I got MELANIN.
Drink water. 8 glasses a day.
Cause that's what they say.

They say you are what you eat.
So I strive to eat healthy .
My goal in life is not to be rich or wealthy.
Cause true wealth, comes from good health and wise ways.

Goin' a catch the Santa Fe
Goin'a drink good liquor
And let all women be.

Surrounded by the lovely but yet feel like a loner
Could be an organ donor
The way I'd give up my heart 
But never know because shit I never tell her
Ask me how I'm feeling I'd holla that it's irrel'
I don't get myself caught in the jello jella, 
And pudding pops that other opt to call falling in love but
For the record have you ever rode a horse?
Likely you just sent me to Pluto, I said of course
But if you ain't a sweety indeedy I won't endorse
Han Solo till I'm hit by bullets, obey the force
Bewitch you, and I rich you in better time permits
For now show me samples, examples why you're the shit

Way up on the summer range.
Found a place to make my bed
As the evening shadows spread
Beyond the campfire light,
In the stillness of night,
Came the call of a coyote choir,
And the song
Of the wind in the wire.

As it strummed the rusted strings,
It sang of long-forgotten things.
Many moons and many suns
Of the real Americans.
When the arrow and the bow
Stalked the range
Of the buffalo,
And the call of the coyote choir
Knew no song
Of the wind in the wire.

As the ghostly balladeer
Hypnotized me, I could hear
Bugle calls, and battle cries.
Broken promises and lies.

Still sing their sad refrain

I walk the earth the wrong way,
Made my pretension and fulfilled the worst,
My past is cursed, the wrong way.

(The wrong way. The wrong way.)

Your glass is half,
His glass is full,
My glass is empty.
You're running short,
Of not enough,
Well I've got plenty.

I've come a long way,
I went the wrong way.

And who I am, is so goddamned

I'm not the Master of the Universe,
I walk the earth the wrong way,
Made my pretension and fulfilled the worst,
My past is cursed, the wrong way.

And when I die I'm gonna fly,
And come and get you.
And when you try and run,
I'll be the curse above you.

It's got to end. It's got to end.

In the race for disaster I will come in first,
That's what I've learned the hard way.

If you want to know
How far to go,
to Hell, just ask me.
If you want to see
The view from your knees,
Come down and join me.

I've come a long way,
I went the wrong way. [x3]",Rock,sad,2009

He had lots of nights to love me away from you

There's nothing you could ever do to keep me from stopping you

Yet He could stop the rising storm
With a gesture of His hand
But He chose to use His hands to heal
Hearts of darkness, hearts of stone
Just like mine would be revealed

He was a man of no reputation
And by the wise, considered a fool
When He spoke about faith and forgiveness
In a time when the strongest arms ruled

But this man of no reputation
Loved the weak with relentless affection
And He loved all those poor in spirit just as they were
He was a man of no reputation

It was said this man brought only confusion
That He'd achieve his ends by any means
And the truth that it brings revolution
And for once they were right
The truth set us free

The hearts of the captive were his only concern
And the powerful knew their days were ending

He was a man of no reputation
And by the wise, considered a fool
When He spoke about faith and forgiveness
In a time when the strongest arms ruled

But this man of no reputation
Loved the weak with relentless affection
And He loved all those poor in spirit just as they were
He was a man of no reputation

One day soon the gates of heaven will open wide
And the Prince of Peace will come back for His bride
But for now we live on these streets
Forbidding and tough

Where push always comes to shove
And it's said love's never enough
Where a prophet in rags gives hope to a fearful world
No injustice, no heart of darkness
Will keep this voice from being heard

He was a man of no reputation
And by the wise, considered a fool
When He spoke about faith and forgiveness
In a time when the strongest arms ruled

But this man of no reputation
Loves us all with relentless affection
And He loves all those poor in spirit, come as you are

So they probaly told you go with the flow
Just so that I don't explode

The one with Benzino did

Before they cut her stomach open and lipoed it

Cause they know that they don't spit the same
It's a shame, what people do for 10 minutes of fame
Everyday it's the same thing
People in this game try to buddy buddy us
Just to get close enough to study us
Everybody just wants to have somethin to do with that

They after that Shady/Aftermath money

It's like a monopoly

And a damn slot machine at the same time as each other

When we rhyme with each other

Then we thought with each other

Both robbed of our mothers
Our fathers ain't want us
What was wrong with us, was it our fault
Cause we started thinkin God doesn't love us
Two hard motheruckers who just happened to meet at the right time
What a coincidence cause when 50 got shot up in Jamaica Queens
I still remember the call up in chunking cause

Big L had just got popped just a month before
If 50 lives he's gettin dropped from Columbia
Two years later me and Doc had to come and operate
That's when he popped up a number one
And we ain't never gonna stop if you wonderin
Even if I'm under the gun 

You ain't gotta agree all the time with me
Or see eye to eye there'll always be animosity between you and I
But see the difference is if it is I could give a shit 
Still gonna conduct motherfuckin buisness as usual

Ego's aside, fore I bruise em' all 
Swallow your pride fore I step on it with shoes you call Nike's
Earth links how do you like these you gotta love them
Look at the bottom of em' they're like cleats

My man Tom introduced us but I was too shy to say hi 
When I finally built up enough nerve to drop a line 
You made it clear you wasn't just another MySpace mistress
 
And I didn't take it personal 
When you ignored my request to be your friend I spilled my guts and hit send 
Waited 2 weeks for a response and got nothing 
Honestly it only made me want you more 

Week 4 rolled around and I was this close to letting go 
But something wouldn't let me even though I hardly knew you 
It was plain to see we were meant to lock lips 
You knock me out with the brass knuckle tats on your hips 

I was on this website late night lurking 
When I got a message from you that was labeled urgent 
You said you weren't impressed by lame dudes with no game 
They're all the same tryin' to get your instant messenger name 

But the fact that you hittin' me back made me smile

I never see my face in your Top 8
Approaching 6 weeks now, it's kinda obvious that you're either occupied or playing a game 
All my money's on the latter, this is not a LOL matter 
Why would you pass up a chance this great? 

If there were two forces and I split them down the middle, I could swing back and forth for 3 days 
Rephrase
If I had two horses, and I beat them with authority, I'd gallop all the way to Canada to see your face

She sat silent at the table
Her boots were brown, well should she leave town
To play the role of lover expatriate
A nod to the waiter, always her flirty behavior
You know she always gets one on the house
She pulls out a letter
From a bag under her sweater
And before she reads she straightens her blouse

There's a passion in being alone
A grace in a loveless time
There's no new cross, there's no new sign
Only the sun and the changing tide

And out of respect, well really must confess
I never lost your number
I never lost your address
And if we remain friends at best
Sometime later no, no not yet
We'll smile and remember it like this

She put back the letter
One tear falls like a feather
And disappears on the bar room floor
The gratuity included
You know the letter concluded
P.S. with all my love

There's a passion in being alone
A grace in a loveless time
There's no new cross, there's no new sign
Only the sun and the changing tide

Blinded I run down these paths
By heart I know them
They lead to the soaring cliffs
Stout they stand above the water's edge
Lifeless

And this is my foundation
Cold stone
Formed only by winds and time
How invulnerable
Lifeless

Ahh...
I have longed to be at one with this
Yet, the waters call my name

For once I wish to see
The entity behind the voice
The face of this seduction
The beauty of my pain

Am I blessed or am I cursed by thy presence?
What is my crime?
What is my deed?
Is this life my redemption?
Shall I repent or proceed?

I hate my flesh
Its dimension poisoned my soul with doubt
It made me question the essence of...
The 'I'

Slaves are those of this world
Given freedom to lay the chains upon The Master
The wolf is no longer free
Release the chains and come for me

Suddenly, his mournful cries were stunned.
Out of the cold mist came three enthralling ships.
Sails torn by many a storm, and the bows adorned by the
most fierce gargoyles he'd ever laid eyes upon. Yet, the
crew they bore... Three times twelve in numbers. They
stood motionless, wrapped in grey, worn gowns.
And from behind their shadowed faces the seductive chanting.
Bidding him on board. without hesitation, he accepted.
And away they sailed...

Upon these seas
Wherein I drowned so many times
I scatter the ashes of destiny
Still my flame is in hunger

With fire in my heart
Shall I greet the shores ahead
Though, I know not what will burn...

Desire...

Ahh...
In the distance
I hear the waves wash over solid ground
And in this moment I am struck blind

Grant me sight so I can see
That which lies ahead of me
Cursed be my mortal eyes
For dying in this realm of death

Hear my call...

I return to the soaring cliffs
They truly shine of strength
Even though I nothing learned
With strength I burn...",Rock,sad,1997

If they break the rules, I give 'em a crutch
If they on the come up and I feel 'em I give 'em some dust
If they talkin shit I'ma bust at 'em and get 'em to hush
Get away clean, go high on the meter, I got the streetsweeper
A creeper believe I get deep as the word of a preacher (and I)

Was all you ever needed
Oh it used to be enough

Remember when love
Was a promise we would give our lives to keep
And no river ran as deep

But was I chasin' rainbows
Blinded by the sun
And did I take for granted
I'd be the only one?

I didn't know you were so lonely
Am I to blame for makin' you that way?
Did I neglect all that mattered?
With my head so far above
The clouds I didn't see
That it was raining on our love

I was taking all the love you had to give
But I was too lost in life to know
That without my love in return you could not live
Now she gives the love I did not show 

I didn't know you were so lonely

They've got nothing to hide
But the rich recite in numbers
Their fear resounds in side

Children starve by the millions
The false of the lame
Of the foolish few who knew them
Then led them to the shame

The king he knights the players
They all know the score
But nobody told his mistress
She was pushing forty-four

I don't want to know
Where we're heading for
We don't have long to go
We'll hear footsteps in the dawn 
REFRAIN
'Cause it's just some sort of
Crazy ride we're on 


The queen she knows the exit
She's been there once or twice
Whe her saviour got ostricized
For selling free advice

And her knight in shining armour
Comes sliding through the door
Sporting suggestive glances
At all the dancers on the floor

Well I dreamt all those lonely people
I knew them by their names
But their faces lost their identity
In the fury of the flames

They talked in foreign riddles
Lik actors on a stage
But when the word came they were standing scared
Lost in a doomed age

You didn't know who would have control

Where it took seconds to shape fortunes
Your pains it weighed down hell
Spilling blood to cleanse the memories
That you know made you so frail

Empty eyes look through the barrel, sweating fingers on the gun
One push off the threshold to target sympathies
Just a broken statue and the world remains unchanged
So close and still no place where anything would end

Trapped between blooded walls
And the fight was there today
Fists breaking against the concrete
None to forgive no strength to run

How could it be how would it end?
When you wake up you wish them to cry
Fragments of this being fragments of its meaning to burn away

Suffocating in the grasp of this hate
Driven to fire your last round
Escape from the air and drown under the earth
Dead mirror by the wayside, nowhere to turn

An empty shell buried to the ground
Prepare yourself to forfait
Another saviour just another failure
Where bleak winds grind the surface

Fear and regret stain dim recollections
An act of rash solutions
Last one there, the broken statue
Built with hands that are bleeding

Empty eyes look through the shattered image
And their pain it weighs down hell
Spilling blood to cleanse the memories
That you know make you so frail

Come to spawn 
From the sun they crawl 

With the night 
Dies the calm 
With revulsion 
Comes the spite 

With the light 
Come the lightmares 
Waking Moloch 
Comes with the fall 

Succumb 
Withdraw your soul from this fallacy 
This infamy is not for us 

With the night 
Comes deliverance 
Comes the spark 
That sets us alight 

With the dark 
Comes remembrance 
Comes the halo 
Comes the flight 

And the ground takes a fall 

Torn upon winds of witchery 
Resplendent wings unfold 
Revelling in lucid lechery 
We invoke what no eye can behold 

Azure, her gaping portal 
I blaze in ecstasy 
The goddess calls, immortal 
Shrugs off all treachery 

Stay down 
Wait for evenfall 
For the night to embrace us again 
Wait for evenfall 

Sleep now 
Wait for evenfall 
For the abyss will set us free 
Wait for evenfall",Rock,sad,2010

Forgive, forget all of our broken promises
We run, run, run to loose it all

And I left a trail but noone missed me in, in the end
I'll blend, I'll blend in with the shade I've been
But where, where do i begin, if i want to learn to

A glance turned to a stare and you hardly knew my face

If I could just get over this hump, but I need something to pull me out this dump
I took my bruises, took my lumps, fell down and I got right back up
But I need that spark to get psyched back up in order for me to pick the mic back up

I don't know how or why or when, I ended up in this position I'm in
I'm startin' to feel distant again, so I decided just to pick this pen
Up and try to make an attempt to vent, but I just can't admit
Or come to grips with the fact that I may be done with rap, I need a new outlet

And I know some shit's so hard to swallow, but I just can't sit back and wallow
In my own sorrow, but I know one fact, I'll be one tough act to follow
One tough act to follow, I'll be one tough act to follow
Here today, gone tomorrow, but you'd have to walk a thousand miles

In my shoes just to see what it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes, just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine, go inside each others' minds
Just to see what we'd find, look at shit through each others' eyes

But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you 

I think I'm startin' to lose my sense of humor, everything's so tense and gloom I
Almost feel like I gotta check the temperature of the room, just as soon as I
Walk in, it's like all eyes on me and so I try to avoid any eye contact
'Cause if I do that, then it opens the door for conversation, like I want that

I'm not lookin' for extra attention, I just wanna be just like you
Blend in with the rest of the room, maybe just point me to the closest restroom
I don't need no fuckin' man servant, tryin' to follow me around and wipe my ass
Laugh at every single joke I crack and half of 'em ain't even funny like 
Unfortunately I am, I just hide behind the tears of a clown
So why don't you all sit down, listen to the tale I'm about to tell
Hell, we don't gotta trade our shoes and you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles

In my shoes just to see what it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes, just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine, go inside each others' minds
Just to see, what we'd find, look at shit through each others' eyes

They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you 

Nobody asked for life to deal us, with these bullshit hands we're dealt
We gotta take these cards ourselves and flip 'em, don't expect no help
Now I could have either just sat on my ass and pissed an' moaned
Or take this situation in which I'm placed in and get up and get my own

I was never the type of kid to wait by the door and pack his bags
Or sat on the porch and hoped and prayed for a dad to show up who never did
I just wanted to fit in, in every single place, every school I went
I dreamed of being that cool kid, even if it meant actin' stupid

Aunt Edna always told me, 
Meanwhile I'm just standin' there, holdin' my tongue tryin' to talk like this
Till I stuck my tongue on that frozen stop sign pole at 8 years old
I learned my lesson then 'cause I wasn't tryin' to impress my friends no more

But I already told you my whole life story, not just based on my description
'Cause where you see it from where your sittin' it's probably 110% different
I guess we would have to walk a mile in each others' shoes at least
What size you wear, I wear 10's, let's see if you can fit your feet

In my shoes just to see what it's like, to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes, just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine, go inside each others' minds
Just to see what we'd find, look at shit through each others' eyes

But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh

Yeah, to my babies, stay strong. Dad'll be home soon.

I'll be comin around the ghetto when I come kickin one for the treble
Y'all can't stoop to my level, I'm like the devil or whatever
I'm pickin up and throwin 'em down like dishes 
Call me Kenny Anderson cuz I slam those Southern bitches
I ain't braggin, folks draggin me up and down the road
To be fucked up when I gets into my clownin mode
Then go to clown up on they ass like Bozo
Oh no, then dance on top of they asses like I was Jo Jo Dancer
Come Comet, come Dasher, come Prancer
Come niggaz with machine guns, I think that is the answer 
But the question 'Should we take that bullshit from them people?'
I'm makin 300 on my SAT and I am equal
Ain't no sequel, no saga, no way out, I'm nervous
I've had it up to fo'head of niggaz tryin to serve us
To graduate is really becomin a very stressful journey
I feel like a steering wheel, for them is tryin to turn me
Into a hate monger, and I'm wishin and I wonder
Damn, will I graduate before I hit the summer
I think not, Officer Friendly tryin to dig up in me
He said I'm half assed and got no future 
And so he sent me up the creek and shit
Strokin like hell without no paddle
But niggaz is gettin smart, we back on the saddle
No longer, y'all know y'all had us down for some years
It's the call of da wild nigga, uh, there it is

Chorus: Cee-Lo

I hear voices in my head and they keep callin me (repeat 4X)

[T-Mo]
As I step, the stage is empty
No words as I serve with my Southern dialect, so I get respect
Don't call me T, it's a T thang with a G swang
Let my nuts hang down to the flo' main
Smokin that dang dang, makin mics swang
In my 2-8-0 Z, nobody can see me
Cruisin down the block, just like I was a squirrel
In a world full of nuts, damn
I'd probably be mad even if I called him Uncle Sam
So bring dough to the Goodie Mo-B

Yeah, I'm steady buckin muthafuckas 
Not duckin 'em like the goose, I'm heavily strapped, yeah niggaz
Squeezin rhymes like that noose around your neck
You can't hang with this, see ain't no thangs to this
I show no pity so take off because I'm dangerous
I breaks 'em off like I was Beat Street, see I be breakin
Speakin of breakin, break on how to get your life taken, boy
Fuckin around with me will get your cabbage cut, your wig split
Simply means I'm bringin the funk with the hollow tips
Playa shit is how I'm kickin it
Comin around the ghetto, victims soft as a tack on a jackass
So fuck it or flip it, I'll still be a playa
Puffy afro with nigga naps off in my hair
Shit, that's quickly how I run my shit and that's how it be
That nigga B-I-G B-O-I, that be me, ye
See I'm a playa, got my struggle on
Thinkin about the volume and thickness of my bankroll
You see that cash is in my shit like colon cancer
Even though I never smoke that shit like...yeah
I give a call of da wild to my niggaz around the projects
So don't flex or get served with a pop neck shit
OG, original gangsta, not quite
But maybe when I'm locked up, liftin weights, gettin swole right
Life's a bitch with a G-string cuz these off in your ass with it hey
So you can see who can really hang
But y'all don't wanna do nothin, y'all can go to hell
Ain't no playas in office cuz I'm locked off in a cell
So can you feel me, nigga

Khujo, comin in dope, bring it
I got more problems than the average Joe
So don't come 'round me with your flim flam, hot damn
It's a jack, top of the burbs, and my notebook is a bird
K's madness into cappin
Throwin to do more load, so my fire lookin through the want ads
And only red hot, desire in your pot with somethin wicked
But you can't feel it, stickin out your monkey ass
I could let shit rot in the past, now it's time to blast they ass
Shhh...Mr. Knighton take off your hat
Can't even my wear my locs in
Demon eye scopin, oh my, peripheral vision got it 
Made you go on your hoe's bar
Decisions, decisions to make, oops, here comes the Goodie Mo crew
And they just might want to battle you
Out with the quickness
The price of livin is beginning to be a risky business
Unkay, Parkay. 
How do you like the taste of hot butter meltin through your biscuits?

in the right and the wrong
a tribute to the world that
blood is thicker than water

I'm tryin to say that I need you,
Brother

And father, I'm in need of your hand
so I can face the world bravely
and father, do you understand
what it is you mean to me

Like a warrior you always conquered
every battle you had to face
And through the hard times
when life was a bitter fight
it's you who would give
so unselfish you lived
A tribute to the world that blood
Is thicker than water

A brand new emptiness inside
I wish that I could fill the space
It's not my place to take the place

This loss has her alone once more

She stays together strong as stone

She stops my rain, she calms my storm
Miracles she can perform
I've seen tough times, she's seen me through
And always knew just what to do

So many rely on her, I'm one of them and I know it
When demons haunt inside of her she fights hard not to show it

I've seen my girl forced to take
Pain, tragedy, and much heartache
The tears she hides, the smile she fakes
And through it all, she doesn't break

I don't know where she finds the strength
I'm only glad that she can
Just when I think my girl is down
She's on her feet again

She stops my rain, she calms my storm
Miracles she can perform
I've seen tough times, she's seen me through
And always knew just what to do

So many rely on her, I'm one of them and I know it
When demons haunt inside of her she fights hard not to show it

I've seen her world before my eyes
Get filled with evil, painful, spiteful lies
Still she fights, still she tries
And she will fight until she dies

Demons haunt inside of her
Demons haunt inside of her
Still she fights and still she tries
Demons haunt inside of her

I miss the seasons in the comfort of your smile

Sometimes this song feels like a dream,
I'm waiting for someone just to wake me up from this life
As I look out on these fairgrounds,
I remember how our family split apart

I don't think I ever told you,
but I know you always did your best
in the hard times that only made us stronger

As I sit here all alone,
I wonder how I'm supposed to carry on
when you're gone

I'll never be the same without you,
I love you more than you will ever know
So maybe now you finally know:
sometimes we're helpless and alone,
but you can't let it keep you weighted down
You must go on

Do you ever feel like crying?
Do you ever feel like giving up?
I raise my hands up towards the sky
and say this prayer for you tonight,
because nothing is impossible

As I sit here all alone,
I wonder how I'm supposed to carry on
when you're gone

I'll never be the same without you,
I love you more than you will ever know
So maybe now you finally know: 
sometimes we're helpless and alone,
but you can't let it keep you weighted down

Don't seem like happiness will come along
I've been lonely so long
Don't seem like happiness will come along

Yes, I know what it feels like to be lonely
To have your friends turn their backs on you
To never know the real meaning
Of peace of mind, oh

Just can't seem to get ahead in life
Ooh, nothin' I do ever turn out for the right

Won't somebody help me please

'Cause I've been lonely for so long
Don't seem like happiness will come along
I've been lonely for so long
Don't seem like happiness will come along

I've been down so long
I've been down so long
I've been down so long
I've been down so long

I get lonely, I get lonely

Ask yourself, it might be true

On and on the hour's upon you now it won't be long
You feel it coming?

Well, we'll put you in a uniform

TRALCUP128F426247F.h5,Amil,Anyday,"Anyday 

(Verse 1)
Call this bitch yor nigga when time is rough
I lost a lot when you fell, life is hard to bluff
You think its hell where you at 
Shit its hell on the streets
You maintaining in the Bing, I'm surviving to eat
Don't think am wilding, flexing whips and stuff
Thinking I'm lost laying down
Sex for trips and stuff
I'll admit it I'm use to the finer things,
We had major names even on the minor things
Everywhere we went, mad bitches sizing me up
You know they tight now, shit I get to drive the trucks
But I wish you were spreading it riding it rough
I think I miss that more then you buying me stuff
Since you got knocked your man tried to hollar at me
And those nigga's you stuck, they throwing dollars at me
But you know this gaming, and Im just keeping it real
Holding you down until you back on the field

(Chorus 2x)
Feels like I do
I feel when feeling down
In the ground feeling down
It can be most anyday

(Verse 2)
Don't worry 'bout these streets I'm conrolling these grounds
I might slip and miss a V-I but I'm holding it down
Got the kids to take care its hard out here
And its tearing my heart to play my part out here
I seen that snitch and you know I got plots 4 years
And your bid make me feel like I got the chair
But ain't nobody tapping this I rather tap my own
Watching tapes we made while I'm resting alone
Wishing you home, pictures of you flipping the chrome
What kind of chic will leave her man when he out the zone
Me without you is like a stickman without a silencer
Got me X-ing off days on the calendar
I miss loading the glock so you could control the block
I miss watching you work the dogs to tighten the lock
Think of the time boo pushing it like a 6 double o
You get your weight up I'm a drain you once they let go

Chorus

(Verse 3)
I can see us back on the bricks, me on your shoulder
Letting bitches know they wishes to have you are over
So you ring your broads while you locked away
I know its hard for a nigga on top not to play
See Amil's the one you kept draped in ice
I'm the one waiting silk down caked in spice
Waiting for your calls or my box to vibrate
Hoping you want me to come scoop you not being more weight
I fell from Gucci sandals back to no name brands
From a six and a mansion to beating the sands
Staying true make ends meet to have enough for the love I take
All-savage and stuff
Have a brick where most F.E.D.S. dare to touch
Fear none to see the cash, and us popping the clutch
Chopping a Dutch-flip cop twice as much living low key
A minute then heist and stuff
If I have to wait while you gone I'm a take what comes
If you don't see cash, know its hard in the slums
Cause I ran through the stash and it ain't no funds",Hip Hop/Rap,sad,2000

Pleasure to meet you but better to bleed

Skinned her alive, ripped her apart
Scattered her ashes, buried her heart
Rise up above it, high up above and see

Whatever you do, don't be afraid of the dark
Cover your eyes, the devil inside

It's like I got the 4 4 cocked 
On the block in it two door dropped 
And my spot is keepin' but hot 
The pussy ass cop throw some murder in the lot 
My nigga got popped with a bullet that was meant for me 
The adapt by T's and B's and the regencies 
F**k what the reason be I'ma start squeezin' these 
Them niggas ain't G's they wanna be thugs 
And it ain't shit these ain't no muthaf**kin' slugs 
The fools and plugged plus ain't no hoes over here 
I done dropped more dead bodies than tears 
Brought to life momma's worst fears 
Pictures of a son dyin' from that hot ones flyin' 
Baby mama's cryin' at the funeral 
'Cause the magnum lit him like a black (?) 
When I rolled out on his ass on the solo 
I caught him up on mo-mo cookin' up co-co 
I got to tip on the low-low 
Bust it there like po-po takin' lives with the, oh no 
It's a 4-4 many missles with a silent sub for the whistle 
My favorite pistol 
'Cause when I let that bitch ride 
I know the homicide is being counted out, it's official 
Niggas steady bumpin' guns, but don't want none 
Because of these hot ones that explode on contact 
A maniac just prepared to die in combat 
Besides all that my 4-4 keeps my laced: Dawg he paid and safe 
I can see the fear in your face as I reach my waist for this warm embrace 

(Chorus) 
I got plenty love for the 4-4 
But when I pick it up, I don't wanna let it go 
Because a nigga straight lovin' your warm embrace 
I got plenty love for the 4-5 
But when I pick it up, I don't wanna let it ride 
But still I bust 'cause I survive from your warm embrace 
I got plenty love for the nine-mill 
And when I pick it up, I don't really wanna kill 
But still I bust because I'm needin' your warm embrace 
All you muthaf**kas better duck and hide 
Before I let it ride, the sucka stepped aside 
Still I bust because I'm lovin' your warm embrace 

(Mayz) 
I love the element of surprise when I'm taking these hoes lives 
With my customized 4-5 
Get enough ammunition to knock off you, your crew and some more guys 
You muthaf**kas better get wise 
Make sure your first shot is sweet, tryin' to kill the elite 
'Cause you ain't gettin' no more tries 
Make the nigga's nubian mother weap, but f**k it 
As long as I don't get whole cries 
Put the beam between his eyes and make that bitch nigga so wise 
No matter what the size of the warm embrace of my forty-five 
Make sure that nigga crossed me dies 
You don't wanna throw them thangs 
When I cocked and aim (?) think in these few seconds time 
But Mayz ain't new to the game 
I use the spark when we start to light up this thunderin' crime 
But niggas get bucked for dime and it's like you're a magnet for sin 
(?) pretend to be your friend 'til they get close enough to your ends 


To do you in, that shit puts me on ten 
And make me wanna put the barrel of this solid fiend 
Upon under that nigga's chin, plus he talkin' big shit about war 
Like he don't know my stee, now mob's gon' win 
But I dare one of you niggas to say my name 
'Cause I put a f**kin' bullet into your closest skin 
Just to get under your skin like a dirty syringe 
Plus I know you can't win with a gun or a pin 
So when you see Mayz come in the place you better say your grace 
Before I f**k up your face like a can of mace 
Before I get disgraced, I'ma catch a case 
Maybe you hoes fear the wrath of my warm embrace 

(Chorus) 

(Twista) 
Would you (..?..) of the team, for sure 
Hold you ever so tightly, I love you nina and never wanna let you go 
Miss millimeter's makin' the (?) muthaf**kas gotsta be ruckus 
When I get my clutches upon this hoe 
Itchin' to let the barrel blow 
Like a sparrow, how it flow, like an arrow (..?..) 
Spit 'em up and swallow slow 
I reload, clippin' your ass crack, you constantly blast back 
Payback from flashback, some bitches know 
Bust 'til I see the chrome from the intro 
You was f**ked from the phasin', deep with the cuts and abrasion 
Erupts and amazin', nigga, my nina bucked 
F**k the gauge and enemies get (?) up from the blazin' 
Fool you be burnin' them with your black ass 
Murderous hips, hurtin' the grips, ride on personal list 
Deposition die for servin' them six 
Everyone of 'em with a hit but some are missin' of a jerk to the kick 
'Cause I be working my bitch 
Tryin' to pimp her but she a wild and a tame thang 
Kick a static on when she gangbang, blast in the fullest moon 
Niggas better pull it soon or else suffer hellafied bullet wounds 
And even though I stay clubbed with some thugs, why call 'em stug 
When it comes to (?) run about she draw my blood 
Static under the bra 'cause everytime I take a hit at the bud 
And give you a hug you gon' pop up a slug 
Drinkin' remy on the block, gotta bust the glock 
When the henny hit the chest, bustin' smith-n-wess 
F**k the discussion, I'm bustin' 'em all, clutchin' my balls 
If I see I'll be laid to rest, let me hit the sex 
Lose (?) but used to be a problem solver 
But the nina made me a baller 
Go strapped and take the place of the black nine 
Leave 'em flat lines, feelin' fury, you was born to taste 
From my warm embrace 

(Chorus) 

I got plenty love for the 4-4, 4-4, 4-4 
Warm embrace 
I got plenty love for the 4-5 (4-5), 4-5 (4-5), 4-5 
Warm embrace

TRALLAR128F933C692.h5,Pursuit Of Happiness,No Safe Place,"I've got a little girl, though I know it won't be long
Before she finds another boy who will sit her by the fireplace
And sing her a song
It feels like there's no safe place
In a world that's come apart
And the deafening sound of a bursting bubble
Wakes you up with a start
Is there nowhere that is safe
Why can't we change the rules so I win
All I need is an escape
A temporary place to hide
When she's coming in the door when she's walking out the door
hard to tell which is worse
That false feeling of relief when she comes in
Or the empty feeling when she's gone
And every night on the streets the forces of darkness
Score another victory
And I stand with the timid waiting for the devil
To make a martyr of me
[chorus]
Fold up the tents and load up the trucks
'cause it's time to move on
If we only knew where to go
I hope that we'd already be gone
And even when we're lying together, I make sure she falls asleep first
It seems when things are at their best, my mind starts to wander
to things at their worst
So do I fall asleep and dream of a peace that never will come
Or do I roll over and let her break the glass around my heart
And set off the alarm

Strong to the finish when I freak the fly gimmick like
""Du-na-da-du-duh!"" without eating my damn spinach
Cause when I'm on a roll, that's when Redman start
""to chill..."" round off backflip cartwheel
""Ahhhhhh, you guessed it!"" I know
When my afro grow that mean more rhymes to flow
But I continue, on the menu, and send you
On a jam that earthquakes the whole damn venue
It's like this, it's like that, I won't slack
I pack more steel than the cops pack blackjacks
Word is bond, the quiet storm broke your arm
When I sound off from here all the way to Hong Kong
Drop pound for pound to throwdown and strut

Cause I kick the mode to make your brain explode
It's the HUH, the funk, now I'm known around the globe
So buckle up, hush up, while I freak the funk to get down
With the sound, grab my bozack then I freeze now...
... on your mark, get ready, get set, let's go
With the flow to jet like Delta, or Jesse O.
Whiz with the bends I clean my front lens
With a system, that knocks harder than Rin-Tin-Tin
Without question, I'm flexy when I'm sexin
Wicked when I Kick It like A Tribe Called Quest-in
The rude Redman rip backbones and hips to bits
Then split ya from your wrist to your armpits
But true indeed, since pop's dropped the seed
I knew I'd be, the funkiest brother that ever bleeds
Rough and rugged, more nuggets in the bucket
That's dum dum dollars, and yes Redman love it
Pound for pound, I throw down to make ya strut

Let that playa ass nigga Twista be your guide as we go on a ride
where playa hatin killers and the hood niggaz thrive
And lame motherfuckers can barely survive

(Verse 1)
One morning I woke up next to a thick bitch
Took a shower dried off brushed the gold teeth like Slick Rick
Tapped on Obsession colonge like Doug E. Fresh in the flesh
Think I'm blessed with the zest after slippin on my slick fit
The high discover me, hit the front porch
Two women butterly lovely in front of me got my head gone
I sent the bitch in the bed home cuz one of them
got chocolate big thighs and the other one was a redbone
Where y'all goin y'all thick as hell
What's your name I wanna get up with y'all tonight shit
I got some homies that lonely never phony we on some hype shit 
Call up the buddies you be tight with
We ain't really gon be doin too much though
We just ridin around bumpin sounds trippin out while we flame janes 
Tappin the horn at the homies that gangbang
and slang 'caine to maintain to mob's the same thing
Or we can chill at the crib and play spades or kick some ass a bit
Speedpass the clit and get passionate
Grab the buckle and unfasten it
and we can get into some ol' nasty shit
Live if I could decide to try, don't play me bogus
This ain't no spin move and I ain't got no time to lie
Tell your girls we gonna be sliding by
but hit the weed tip first cause my clique got to be riding high
cause it feels so good

(Chorus)
It feels so good how we kick it in the hood like so good 
(When we ridin high)
Rollin through the hood with Phillies and hoes 
Straight pimpin with nowhere to go
And it feels so good the way we kick it in the hood like so good
(When we ridin high)
Rollin through the hood with Phillies and hoes
Straight pimpin with nowhere to go

(Verse 2)
Me and my homies hooked up some cowards took up
when niggas we lust smokin some but the flame tight
Trippin off how we survivin the rugged terrain
and try to hang tight getting fucked up on gang night 
Used to be gang fights now we gotta try to relax with the scrap
Even we sent Deebo back to back to back
We still be holdin' stacks of packs
Rollin through wit black blacks, blunt reds, ash trays, and crack sacks
Hustlin and chillin's what I'm focusin on
Fiendin through bitch's cribs hopin it's on
If ain't no strokin we strollin along
Rollin the chrome out really trippin
because we take the smoke to the dome
Bumpin the tunes while bigger roles and herringbones
glisten from all the sunlight
Peepin the fe's with their hair done tight
Booty hung right and every night we see at least one fight
Hookin up with my fellow Westside cliques 
Now together we mush
but when are we strapped through and rug cutters
Just like the envy and jealousy throughout the other is love brothers
Ridin every one of y'all my muhfuckers
So put the Black Magic on the tires and get the wax off the chrome
We gon' to blaze on till my brain's blown
Hopin to get my thang on
Not matter what block you stay on kick it
Round the world it's the same song
(so the Mobsters just flame on)
For scratch we was willin' to squirt some blood
Now we got up on hittin the cuz
From stealin' tips where they're swum the doves
mo' we got up on some bud
Straight hittin' up the block searching for love
Reach up and hit the deep lung then we gone
Smokin delight the body right what the party like
Are you as live as I come roll with meso we can ride the sky
But only if you let me play with you while we ridin' high
cause it feels so good

(Chorus)

(Verse 3)
Sittin back cruising through the slow breeze
thinkin how can I get mo' cheese
Bumpin a system costin 4 G's
I stay on my P's for the po-P's
Split the Phillie with my door keys
Scoop a female to the crib good get my boy to bring a blessin through
Sit on the floor playin Tekken 2
Lesson two I'm adressin you
Turn out the lights like the World Class Wreckin' Crew
Bring out the best in you 
Confessin true lies about your inner thighs
and where they been hopin maybe you be my lady
What's the potatoes without the gravy
what you feelin on maybe soft with the silicone baby
but can you pay me?
Cause daily we be riding in the dope stroll
while rockin dope flows I'll lose the spot if I choose to stop
We can cruise some blocks and talkin' about
how later on you comin' out your clothes, shoes and socks
Now is that news or not?
Come I step on the gas slow and smoke on this last ""O""
Get a ""B"" and split it now watch me kill it
Tinted windows took a sealin' off in the Astro
on billets take a choke on so I can really feel it
Thinkin' about not having the rich life
but the hood life was still a good life
and that we know always and forever though
for ever more rollin in the ghetto with nowhere to go
and it feels so good

You can see the shark now
Glidin' through the water
Ugly as death.

But the pretty barracuda, don't touch no leavins
Takin' what he wants to

And you can't scare him or entice him

Did you get my message
Didn't, I guess, 'cause if you did you would have called me with your sweet intent
And we could give it a rest instead of beating our breast, making all of the pressure go sky-high

Do you ever wonder what happens to the words that we send
Do they bend, do they break from the flight that they take
And come back together again with a whole new meaning
In a brand new sense, completely unrelated to the one I sent

Did you get my message
Did you get my message, yeah, ooh

Uh oh, where did it go
Must have bypassed your phone and flown right outta the window
Oh well, how can I tell
Should I call the operator
Maybe she know the info
But whether or not if my message you got was too much or a lot to reply
Why not try this for a fact
Should you ever come back
I'd relax and be relieved of all my panic attacks

Ahh oooh

Not much sand in the glass and I'm standing to lose my mind

Do you ever wonder what happens to the words that we send
Do they bend, do they break from the flight that they take
And come back together again with a whole new meaning
To the matter of our love's defense, and please be sympathetic to the time I spent

Did you get my message, ooh
Did you get my message, (Did you now?)
Did you get my message, yeah, ooh

Did you get my message
No, I didn't hear a word
Did you get my message
Now I'm not gonna believe your lies anymore

I don't hear a thing from you and you keep saying you're coming
Did you get my message now that I wanna get back with you
Did you get my message, love that I wanna reconnect with you

She used to drink in the hills
Only now she drinks in the valleys
Where every road has a name like Beechwood Avenue
Or so it seems
A Croydon girl could really hope to find a home
But with a thousand miles of real estate to choose from
You begin to see the value of your freedom...

The moon is bright in the haze above old Hollywood
And deer look down from the hills
And it's three o'clock in the morning
Pill in hand you can hear his golden surfer boys
Crying out, ""Mummy won't come out of the bathroom!""
And you'd hoped he'd say he's sorry if he hit you
But he's buried in the screenplay of his feature

Screen kiss, one screen kiss
Straight from a film I forget who was in
Screen kiss, one screen kiss
Blue filter lens in a pool of vaseline
But all the rushes look the same
Only there's a movie I wouldn't pay to see again
If it's the one with him in

You and I could be a mile above the earth tremors
Hold to me and we'll climb
You could sneak out while he's sleeping
Suicide in the hills above old Hollywood
Is never gonna change the world
Change the world overnight
Any more than the invention of the six-gun--child--
Any more than the discovery of radium,
Or California tipping in the ocean

Or drive a cab in New York 
'Cause to talk to you is harder work 

So what's the point of wasting all my words 
If it's just the same or even worse 
Than reading poems to a horse

And quit before you sweat a drop 
Feed your empty brain

You know playin' blind man's bluff is a little baby's game
You pick up Little Dynamite I'm gonna pick up Little Gun
And together we're gonna go out tonight and make that highway run
You don't have to call me lieutenant Rosie and I don't want to be your son
The only lover I'm ever gonna need's your soft sweet little girl's tongue
And Rosie you're the one

Dynamite's in the belfry playin' with the bats
Little Gun's downtown in front of Woolworth's tryin' out his attitude on all the cats
Papa's on the corner waitin' for the bus
Mama she's home in the window waitin' up for us
She'll be there in that chair when they wrestle her upstairs 'cause you know we ain't gonna come
I ain't here for business baby, I'm only here for fun 
And Rosie you're the one

Rosalita jump a little lighter, 
Senorita come sit by my fire
I just want to be your lover ain't no liar, 
Rosalita you're my stone desire

Jack the Rabbit and Weak Knees Willie you know they're gonna be there
Ah Sloppy Sue and Big Bones Billie they'll be comin' up for air
We're gonna play some pool, skip some school, act real cool,
Stay out all night, it's gonna feel alright
So Rosie come out tonight, Oh baby come out tonight
Windows are for cheaters, chimneys for the poor
Closets are for hangers, winners use the door
So use it Rosie, that's what it's there for

Rosalita jump a little lighter, 
Senorita come sit by my fire
I just want to be your lover ain't no liar, 
Rosalita you're my stone desire

Now I know your mama she don't like me 'cause I play in a rock and roll band
And I know your daddy he don't dig me but he never did understand
Your papa lowered the boom he locked you in your room
I'm comin' to lend a hand
I'm comin' to liberate you, confiscate you, I want to be your man
Someday we'll look back on this and it will all seem funny
But now you're sad, your mama's mad
And your papa says he knows that I don't...
(...have any money)
Oh, your papa says he knows...
(...that I don't have any money)
Oh, so your daddy says he knows that I don't have...
(...any money)
Well, tell him this is last chance
To get his daughter in a fine romance
Because a record company Rosie just gave me a big advance

And my tires were slashed and I almost crashed but the Lord had mercy
And my machine she's a dud out stuck in the mud somewhere in the swamps of Jersey
Well, hold on tight, stay up all night 'cause Rosie I'm comin' on strong
By the time we meet the morning light I will hold you in my arms
I know a pretty little place in Southern California down San Diego way
There's a little cafe where they play guitars all night and all day
You can hear them in the back room strummin'
So hold tight baby 'cause don't you know daddy's comin'

Then up steps another, he gets smothered
That's word to mother, or should I say moms
I drop bombs, scorchin niggaz like napalm
Sucka, boy, get off my shit
Get off my dick so what I make butter hits

Rather bust a fresh line, and get loose to

Makes your girl's rear shake, let me set it straight

But if you took that shit out
and you took all the music out
What would remain?  The voice no doubt
Bless my soul I control

I plan, to keep rap real
so if your shit ain't fat then kneel
You squeal, feeling pain from my oral flex
what about oral sex, which chick's next
To open wide and get a chunk from a real brother
Yeah, some real funk from a real brother
They get sprung and most of them don't recover
But I don't diss em I just talk to em
Cause the sound, of my voice, it does a lot to em
So you and, the niggaz right there
Be aware, like SWV, I'm right here
Waitin to correct your ass
And if you don't follow now I'll disrespect your ass
More Vicious than Sid, do a crime with no bid
I tell a bitch that I didn't when you know that I did
Take a trip to a land a-far
Then come back, and people still know Gangstarr
See I'm the ladies choice

After Reaganomics crack came and more blood spill
I gotta tell shorties now I don't pop pills
The only ecstacy I fuck with rolls with Jalil
No grip, straight line rhymes
Like the grand concourse on 149
In LA the riders ridge was Fairfax and Olympic ???
On the block the Ethiopians kick it (salaam)
You'll learn Angel City'll test you
I move through giving respect where respect's due
Ducking these cops who say they serve to protect you
And handlin my biz so I ain't tryin to impress you

I do strategy, I don't act sporadically
I contemplate, cat I move mathematically
It's Alchemist with Dilated, that's family

How the real fiends cop two each
The game is keeping dope in the streets
So look the world on wheels

Bangin out the illest rides on the streets
Look at the world on wheels

But all the friendly fire is worse than oppression
Pressure more stressin is poured in dead presidents (Rakaa)

But suckers swing rulers like swords that try to measure
While Slick Rick the ruler's at war with INS yo

I ventilate em like I cracked the window and air it out like a Hail Mary to the end zone

When I move stealth (it's mysteries and who-done-its)

Woman speaking in background (from ""Rip Van Winkle"" by Washington Irving):

""Times grew worse and worse with Rip Van Winkle as years of matrimony rolled on; a tart tempter never mellows with age, and a sharp tongue is the only edge tool that grows keener by constant use. For a long while he used to console himself, when driven from home, by frequenting a kind of perpetual club of the sages, philosophers, and other idle personages of the village, which held its sessions on a bench before a small inn, designated by a rubicund portrait of his majesty George the Third. Here they used to sit in the shade, through a long lazy summer's day, talking listlessly over village gossip, or telling endless sleepy stories about nothing. But it would have been worth any statesman's money to have heard the profound discussions that sometimes took place, when by chance an old newspaper fell into their hands, from some passing traveller.

Turned cartwheels 'cross the floor
I was feeling kind of seasick
But the crowd called out for more
The room was humming harder
As the ceiling flew away
When we called out for another drink
The waiter brought a tray

And so it was that later
As the Miller told his tale
That a face at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale

She said there is no reason
And the truth is plain to see
But I wandered through my playing cards
And would not let her be
One of sixteen vestal virgins
Who were leaving for the coast
And although my eyes were open
They might just as well've been closed

And so it was later
As the Miller told his tale
AThat a face at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale

Need more than a straight jacket to restrain me
Or more guns with my prints for you to frame me and mame me

Nigga you better hush, I can mess out the cave 
Niggas still get touched
And them little ones you bust ain't enough for us
Listen here, Mase'll make you disappear
And yo' mouth'll be the reason that you missed this year
Man who needs ya? You don't need me, I don't need you neither
That's why my next Lex gon' be a two seater
And the things I do to you won't leave you beautiful
And though yo' feelin' fuck me, I'm feelin' mutual

I got power, make a call, get a mil' in cash
Like my money and ya ain't cuz they don't tax me
Actually, anything you got to ask me, fax me
I'm no Beamer dreamer, I'm a Bentley man
Car totally smashed threw out 50 grand
How ya figure ya bigger when Mase that nigga
And every style I deliver come with much charisma
Knock it off, now will ya , I'm the one that bitches live for
Don't get me wrong you niggas make it hot I make it sizzler
And I don't know you cats, so don't you get familiar
And if you violate me and mine I guarentee I peel ya

Time is money, when you talk gotta be quick

But I know how it is when ya go into the bar
Got girls overreact, they thowin' you a star 
Got niggas player hatin' don't even know who you are
And go as far as leavin' bullet holes in yo' car
When you're from Harlem World niggas never see yo' views
They wait for you to flop or be on BET News
All they see the G's and jewels, V's that ya cruise
Being the underdogs, they can't wait to see us lose
Don't hate me, thank me

Make you cranky to see me places that you can't be

They're wondering what the day will bring 
Will they be the next one found?

Do you dare to gaze into their hollow eyes, hollow eyes? 
Are they staring holes in you with their hollow eyes, 
Hollow eyes, hollow eyes?

To escape the Haitian heat 
The hunger pains drive them to the street 
Wond'ring if today they'll eat 
Some find food in the refuse heap, others find disease 
Some find it harder just to live when they can die with ease. 

The least of these is hungry. 
The least of these is sick. 
The least of these needs clothing. 
The least of these needs drink. 
The least of these knows sorrow. 
The least of these knows grief. 
The least of these has suffered pain, and Jesus is His name.

With the great feelin of people like the comin of Jesus
While a lot of other niggaz don't be tellin you nothin
That be the same bullshit that's always pushin my buttons
Godly is how we rep this undeniable force
You like a weak preacher, swearin smacked dead on a cross
Kick niggaz like the two back legs of a horse
Chop ya fingers for tryin' to put your hands in the sauce
Sometimes I think that it would be best if you run
And do yourself a favor, cause you got your whole life ahead of you son!
A whole new thang startin for me
Smell so much ass in a spot, the beat got the world fartin for me
When I spit you know I always love to garnish it hard
While you love-it hate-it niggaz trying to tarnish the God
I know some dudes that would love to bring the hatred to y'all
While I continue to bless you with shit that's is sacred to y'all
Even if I had to bend you in place
I always put it down and rep my niggaz from the most genuine place
From my street corner niggaz to my live niggaz everywhere
Too late for turning back, we takin it there

There's a rumbling in the skies
I've been wading through the high muddy water
With the heat rising in my eyes

Every day your memory grows dimmer
It doesn't haunt me like it did before
I've been walking through the middle of nowhere
Tryin' to get to heaven before they close the door

When I was in Missouri
They would not let me be
I had to leave there in a hurry
I only saw what they let me see

You broke a heart that loved you
Now you can seal up the book and not write anymore
I've been walking that lonesome valley
Tryin' to get to heaven before they close the door

People on the platforms
Waiting for the trains
I can hear their hearts a-beatin'
Like pendulums swinging on chains

When you think that you've lost everything
You find out you can always lose a little more
I'm just going down the road feeling bad
Tryin' to get to heaven before they close the door

I'm going down the river
Down to New Orleans
They tell me everything is gonna be all right
But I don't know what  even means

I was riding in a buggy with Miss Mary Jane
Miss Mary Jane got a house in Baltimore
I been all around the world, boys
Now I'm tryin' to get to heaven before they close the door

Gotta sleep down in the parlor
And relive my dreams
I'll close my eyes and I wonder
If everything is as hollow as it seems

Some trains don't pull no gamblers
No midnight ramblers, like they did before

Conspiring with the reef

Her tongue a thirsty knife
And she could take your life
With one good kiss

As morning's light breaks over me?
Know tonight we'll make our bed
At the bottom of the sea

I know the ocean speaks (The stars retreat behind their veil)
I've heard her call to me (The clouds are clinging to your sail)
And smiling in my dreams (The storm is coming, can you see?)
She whispers this:

""Can you see the sky turn red
As morning's light breaks over me?
Know tonight we'll make our bed
At the bottom of the sea""

Who belong to eternity stranded in time

And never stop counting the cost

That held her mother's first kiss in a
Nameless dream
Fall down the stairs again
To feel alive against tommorow
Real love
Or is it me you're after
Is it time
Cause it's now or never
Real love
Real love forever
Is it love
Or just yours to treasure
Real love
Real love
Real love
We never listen
Real love will listen
And tell her of my fortune
Real love is riches
Scratch through the changes
Real love is nameless
So tired and hopeless
Real love is painless
Nobody mentions
We ever move to collect
The solar questions
Demon scorn should not relax
The laws of gravity

It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die

It's real late, 'bout a quarter to one
Thinking about everything we become
And I hate it
I thought we could make it

But I'm ready to dead this
Just wanna forget about it
I saw her pictures
And the letters she sent

You had me thinking
You were out with your friends
I'm so foolish
Play me like I'm stupid
'Cause I thought it was just you and I

Now I look back on the time
That we spent and I
See it in my mind
Playing over and over again

'Cause boy right now
You got me breaking down
And I just can't figure out why
But this is what you say

We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die

We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die

Visions in my mind
Of the day that we met
You showed me things
That I'll never forget

Took me swimming
In the ocean
You had my head up in the clouds
Made me feel like I'm floating
You think I'm playing

When you know it's the truth
Nobody else can do it quite like I do
All my kisses
And my loving
But ain't nobody better than us

Now I look back on the time
That we spent and I
See it in my mind
Playing over and over again
'Cause boy right now
You got me breaking down
And I just can't figure out why

We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die

We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die

I guess it's over indefinitely
But you and I know
It's not that easy to let go
Of everything that we planned
And start all over again

Just blame yourself 'cause you blew it
I won't forget how you do it
Sweet baby this is where the game ends now
Somehow wanna believe you and me
We can figure it out

We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die

You finna make me say boy
I wish that you come hold me
When I'm lonely
When I need someone to talk to

You would phone me
Just like everything you told me
(When we ride we ride, it's till the day we die)
Boy you forgot about the promises you made me
And now we'll let the memories just fade away
But I remember what you used to say
(When we ride we ride, it's till the day we die)

We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride

A new confidence like a new king

To raise a sunken soul
And to the surface shines like a new pin

What junkie says is not what junkie do
But it's all for you
And the tricks he turns will always shine right through
But it's all for you

With the one I missed the most
A concentrated love from a new queen
Like a wave stabilising

And my new victim shines like a new pin

[Gift of Gab] 
We'd like to welcome you all again to the world of vibrations 
Introduction to the nation of revolutionary thoughts 
Hear the sound evolve, expand, and change 
Most of the things that we're sayin' haven't broken through your chatter 
So y'all niggaz still ego trip based and 
Have not begun to taste the kundalini wisdom bliss 
I'm droppin' as a lyric quotin' vessel for the stages 
Play this on your play list 
I like dough 
But musically I'm transcendin' the physical 
And don't blame me for the slang and the words 
God writes these rhymes through me 
I just listen to him 
I'm just livin' duke 
Matrix driven rules haven't fooled me 
Cuz I still think abstract 
And stay metaphysical 
And challenge what is really real 
And keep creatin' with the force to bring rap back 
Not that it's away 
But everybody got somethin' to say 
So let me speak the opposite of what's hot now 
And make that hot 
So it will get exploited 
And the corporation only will back dudes who bite my style 
And they can try and try again 
I've been influenced by a lot of pioneers 
South to the East and West 
But when a hot MC 
Gets on stage with a real MC 
Most of the time the situation gets hostile 

[Chorus: Ledisi] 
We vibrate at higher frequencies 
Welcome to our world and intro to 
Fall into a space 
Where there is no thoughts 
Just moments captured 
Here we go 

We vibrate at higher frequencies 
Let us up inside your head 
Just step inside our world of vibration 
Bump this from your birth to your deathbed 

[Gift of Gab] 
Take time with the pad and the pen to dig within 
In a world of BS that we're livin' in 
To my ears music sound sweet as cinnamon 
So I stay poundin' out tunes and tunes again and again 
In the 5th chapter ladies and gentlemen 
And I still got MCs on my dinner menu 
Write late at night this isn't David Letterman though 
On second thought, I'm like a letter man though 
Let the craft evolve catch a little syndrome 
Shootin' through your vains, vibratin' though your eardrums 
Used to think 30 years old then the end comes 
Now I feel like I'm just gainin' momentum 
Seen the world two times all except for India 
About to vacate there when we finish this one 
Work hard but still some sweep 
We won't mention them 
In fact, they act as fuel for our engine 
Engine engine number 9, mic lynchin' 
When we're done with this these songs are our pension 
MCs are puppets, Me, I'm Jim Henson 
Take a squat or get chopped by the henchmen 
City, town, state arena or convention 
Please believe these the G's that ease pension 
Rakka and Ev said that it's a marathon 
Song after song, we keep on inventin'

Was language that they could not understand
No joy, no peace, no hope in sight

So He came with starlight and love in His eyes
No regal welcome for His infant cries
There have been many babies to become a king
But only one King became a baby

He left behind His throne of pure light
Gave up His crown that we might be free
He chose a manger that Bethlehem night
And reaching through time and space He saw me
With no joy, no peace, no hope in sight

So He came with starlight and love in His eyes
No regal welcome for His infant cries
There have been many babies to become a king
But only one King became a baby

He could have chosen to break through the sky
With anthem and angel wing
But He knew we'd understand a baby's cry
And learn love from a servant King

So He came with starlight and love in His eyes
No regal welcome for His infant cries

For the right raindrop to set 'em free

I thought there was none
That was when I found one
On a dark night in a southern town
You called to me and I turned around
In a perfect moment when the stars aligned
You couldn’t have come at a better time
And every day in my life had led me to
That perfect moment with you

Lucky that we did not meet
Ten years back on the street
So many pages yet to turn
So many dreams still to burn
Oh but I don’t cry for the wasted years
Or the twisted roads that got me here
I have been to the end of the earth
And I know what standing still is worth
In a perfect moment when the stars aligned
Love don’t travel in straight lines
And every day of my life had led me to
That perfect moment with you

Well the wheel of fortune is going round and round
I never thought I would come up when I was down

But a perfect moment when the stars aligned
When you put your hand in mine
And every day of my life has led me to
That perfect moment

Open the gates of the past
With the key to our hearts
Dream of the years gone by
Centuries through mankind's eyes

In the wasteland that grows inside
Within me I shall find myself

Slowly walking, pacing front
See through these blind eyes
Stepping on shadows, touching air
Stones move as I stand still
Seek the answers in the skies
As we don't even know ourselves
Silent, as the sun sets before our eyes

In the wasteland that grows inside
Within me I shall find myself

For years of space technology
Still we haven't learned
Like children we explore
Things we can't yet comprehend

Open the doors of the past

Carrying our own cross

Waiting for the morning light
And all the things I've seen in dreams
Have kept me up all night
Always reaching to the sky
Soft hard stone
I'm sitting here and thinking
Bout all the centuries its known
Got a feeling someone's near
Listening to the East wind moan
You know there's no one here
But I just don't feel alone

Always here with me
Singing your song in the wind at night
You know I've never felt so free
You're my reality
Don't you fade away from me
The wind it paints your face
As it stirs the shifting sand

They leave at your command

takin' out profanity so they can play it though
listen to a hell of a kick and the high hat
going to the record store say ya gonna buy
that the E is connected to the A and the Z ya say Y
so that's how the beats stack it up on material made of hits 
takin' my time of each line to make sure it fits
push play on the instrumental thats recorded
step on stage and I'm suddenly awarded
some sort of track appeared like a plaque
and some hell of a scream from the girls in the back
takin' a bow cause I got style
never at the bottom of the ways on the top of the pile
yo it's Eazy on top even though I'm short 
guarenteed to help when I walk on the court
so get up make some noise for the gangsta clap
gonna tip the laugh I'm not a pranksta
I'm serious Dre my sounds so quit playin' around
cause I'mma break it down

but other suckaz were makin' a rhyme with this
I had to change the tip or make it hyper
but they was rotten, I was gettin' riper
ready to go, like never before
givin' you more because I'm ready to score
Ren is my buddy you can tell I said often
helpin' me destroy the suckaz that's softin'
curin' diseases, my rhyme pleases, throw it a key
balls havin' seasons, this is a doctrine
and I'm locked in, and I made up my mind
and I think I'm gonna rock then
you got beaches chill and I'mma push ya
to freeze after I'll cut ya cause I'mma butcher
and say ya have pricin' and then out ya go
cause a percentage on point bellys are very low
messin' with a gun but once ya get hurt
like a said before ya get rubbed in the dirt
I'm not a law man, but I'mma raw man

and you could see right off I got the most of
the talent, experience or a trade 
and complements for the rhyme thats made

cause I don't need water to clear my throat
comin' from the rain the show is like dancin'

wantin' to get wit me this routine 
keepin' it sprung still stayin' mean

makin' it sound so dope cause I'm a genius

Here today my tomorrow
Where you lead I will follow

No passion missing
Come live with me
Kiss the boys goodbye 
Come live with me
Kiss the boys goodbye 
Come live with me

Dinner parties followed
And all my age implies
My friends began to talk
I began to realise
If half the things they say
Are quarter true of me
Then how can I eclipse the youth
You gave to set me free 

There was something in your smile
That was hard to reconcile
The time had come to testify to reason
Though years will not erase
Remembrance of those days
At least there's no submission to hearts treason 

Here today my tomorrow
No more shame only sorrow
All that kissing
There's something missing
Come live with me
Kiss the boys goodbye 
Come live with me
Kiss the boys goodbye 
Come live with me

Now there's nothing left to cry for
And there's nowhere left to go
Just another hopeless fight
But how were we to know
The strong are sometimes wrong
But the weak are never free
The choice we made we can't evade
Don't try to follow me 

Here today my tomorrow
No more pain only sorrow
All that kissing
There's something missing
Come live with me

Follow again one single piece
of dream afar
Spent my all whole life there,
chasing the hope

A drive so strong,
so deep I cannot see the end
Inborn sense of finding
what's beyond, in the furious storm

Reunifying with air and soil I am part of
Distant yet so close!

Longing for a whisper
that would carry me away
Faced my ultimate desire that was swirling 
through the mazes of my mind

Watch my gold,
it can be never bought or sold
Made up and collected through the years
from emotions and dreams

A noble line I carry on 
Exploring the ways I never saw

Longing for a whisper
that would carry me away
Faced my ultimate desire that was swirling 
through the mazes of my mind

retain your tears of joy
Pushed as far as any wind will go,
a fiery stride to the sun

Clearing my path from anything

To breathe the air and soothe my mind,
I thought of friends and the home I had,
And all those things I left behind.

A silent star shone on me,
My eyes saw a far horizon,
As if to pierce this veil of time,
And escape this earthly prison.

Will there come a time when the memories fade.
and pass on with the long, long years,
When the ties no longer bind?
Lord save me from this darkest fear.
Don't let me come home a stranger,
I couldn't stand to be a stranger.",Christian,sad,1997

And takes to his heels
Out of dark Northland
The murky house of Sara
He whirled out of doors as snow
Arrives as smoke in the yard
To flee from bad deeds

There he had to become someone else
He must change his shape
As an eagle he swept up
Wanted to soar heavenward
The sun burnt his cheeks
The moon lit his brows",Rock,sad,1994

So lonely my tears fall down my brain
Rode my train for a cheap price, baby it's no surprise

A sinking feeling, like I'm falling in love again

Of thoughts and shimmering hours of May
And all its feelings

I dared to walk down by the lane
Calm and fearless in the rain
I felt that you were by my side
Calm and tender

You are the reason for this May
Has washed the purple clouds away

You are the reason for this May
Has washed the purple clouds away

You are the reason for this May
Is warm and fills me with its rays

Listen, all the time we witness miracles,
All the time!

We thought that anyone that has a life
Bear the cross of the passion and of the time
Oh, the way I was blind!

The time I stumbled over your blue eyes
I felt like falling into a pool of joy
And a sort of miracle happened
The ancient fortress vanished at your smile

You are the reason for this May
Has blown all darkness far away
You are the reason for this May
Is warm and fills me with its rays",Rock,happy,2006

Yes it gets to be useless, yes it's useless to me
And I think I'm lost, when I'm lost inside this jungle
Can't see the forest for the tress
Well pretty little woman come and get me
Try me, try me one more time

Cant' fix this broken heart of mine

Be content to light your own path
And burn what you have crossed
The bridges were frail
The people, pretended

Storm forth with the light of the inflamed
Reclaim and ignite the sky
Brightly to blind
Rip off the veneers enabling opportunists to thrive
Dam the rise of grime and rats

More sickening than a social circle that believes itself charmed
Are the writhing droves of blowhards and yes men
Clamoring to slither in
Stay sovereign on the outside

We are who finished last
The unaffected
Contrasting the wide and white
We are who finish last

Indignant
The iron to gleaming teeth
The salt on saccharin

Proudly in their darkness
Lit from within

Glad hands grabbing for brass rings
Painting their bricks gold
Keen sycophants filthy scheming
Furthering the feuds of their adored
They have picked their enemies impeccably
Very keen indeed

And so siege the scorned

We are naught but beds of thorns and dark horses
Unwelcome guests who will just not mind their place
A single musket ball to pierce and lodge inside
And lead the circle to crack

We cast no shadow
The stars do not shine here
No genuine light to be found
Only rays of cold, synthetic beams on a mock aristocracy
so the vain and insecure can feel revered and cared for
For a cheap, fleeting moment
Truly noble

Struggling on, just to hold on
I just wanna know, why is it me?

In a tear there is a message from the heart
Detached from the good, it's hope gone astray
I cry so hard sometimes
Too scared to think what will bring tommorow
Already much more than I can handle today

I can't breathe, suffocate as I'm buried by hate
And so sadly I learn, there's no justice to fate
I just wanna know why is it me?
Losing the race with thoughts out of place
I just wanna, know why is it me?

You aint got a monopoly on sorrow

'Cos I don't feel that I deserve the sunshine's rays.
The darkness helped until the whiskey wore away,
And it was then I realized that conscience never fades.
When you're young you have this image of your life:
That you'll be scrupulous and one day even make a wife.
And you make boundaries you'd never dream to cross,
And if you happen to you wake completely lost.
But I will fight for you, be sure that
I will fight until we're the special two once again.

And we will only need each other, we'll bleed together,
Our hands will not be taught to hold another's,
'Cos we're the special two.
And we could only see each other, we'll breathe together,
These arms will not be taught to need another's,
'Cos we're the special two.

I remember someone old once said to me:
That lies will lock you up with truth the only key
But I was comfortable and warm inside my shell,
And couldn't see this place could soon become my hell.
So is it better to tell and hurt or lie to save their face?
Well I guess the answer is don't do it in the first place.
I know I'm not deserving of your trust from you right now,
But if by chance you change your mind you know I will not
Let you down 'cos we were the special two, and will be again.

And we will only need each other, we'll bleed together,
Our hands would not be taught to hold another's,
'Cos we're the special two.
And we could only see each other we'll breathe together,
These arms will not be taught to need another's
'Cos we're the special two.

I step outside my mind's eyes for a minute.
And I look over me like a doctor looking for disease,
Or something that could ease the pain.
But nothing cures the hurt you bring on by yourself,
Just remembering, just remembering how we were

And we would only need each other, we'd bleed together,
These hands would not be taught to hold another's,
We were the special two.

Was a travesty that many just call luck

Or stick around and just relive your past

Everybody knows it but no one tries to stop it 
Cause she barely even knows him but if she could see inside 
Everything is quiet as she waits to tell him who she is 

Is this all we get to be absolute 

Quiet but I'm sure there is something here 
Tell me everything cause I want to hear 

It's a kiss sits upon on her lips that waits for planes and battle ships 
She wants to be a dancer and he has got a picture 
On his wall and it's a sailor in a new port every night 
Yet man was born to trouble like sparks fly upwards innocent 

Is this all we get to be absolute

seven layers to be exact eliminate the whack
with a firm brush stroke I mc paintily
lyricists begin crumbling from my stumbling technique
as I tweak your audio and visual keep my drips minimal messages subliminal
cause me and rap go way back we compliment
so together we enhance one another that's common sense
high intensity catches the eye your jaw drops
be a real critic not explicit with false props
I keep my darks deep my lights bright I'm very thorough

a canvas or a beat
CD or LP

you know the cycle ass ho don't front
it goes inspiration and productivity then a sense of self worth and in steps depression
like back and forth and forth and back
should I paint a picture or record a track
a gift or a curse I don't know I'm still undecided
but over the years I've found clever ways to hide it
and those that lack the passion I have may despise it
but my momma made me this way I thank her everyday
so tell them kids to keep coloring outside the lines
until they lose they limitations and they minds is free
tell them teachers that you want your money back this time
and tell Bob Ross thanks for all the happy little trees

TRAZUVU128F42BABF4.h5,Jesse Malin,Broken Radio,"I was thinking about another time still in my mind
When I used to know a little girl high on this world
Your baby loves you more than you know
Raised on rivalry and rock'n roll
Moving to the motor City soul 
She lets go
On the radio
Well we never had a lot of cash
But we loved those kids
Some say that she missed the boat
But she just burned the bridge
The angels love you more than you know
Raised on robbery and rock'n roll
Moving to the Motor City soul
She takes hold
On the radio
Stomachache Sundays
And books we never read
Well I was hoping one day
We might meet again
She used to talk about astrology
She was born in June
She danced with strangers and celebrities
Empty stars and the full moon
I was thinking about the universe
For what its worth
Or the one about the Phoenix bird
That died and then returned
The angels love you more than you know
Raised on robbery and rock' n roll
Moving to the Motor City soul
Moving to the Motor City soul
Sometimes I see her face
When there's no place to go

Now we gotta react, we gotta think fast. Side-bust hits leave us delirious. Outspoken hearts, restless as sharks. My life, my pride. Save me the daylight. Bring me home. It's OK because my way has only got to work for me. I'm trying my hardest to make the most of every minute. Time flies. And the top of the world is calling. Time grabs me by the shoulders.

I begged you not to leave, but you left any-way
I saw my castle tumble back to earth and there was I
With mem'ries of my castle in the sky.

The trouble that we're havin', does it mean there's someone new
Or am I just bothered by the thought of losing you
Will someone come and take you, will I lose you by and by
Like I lost you in my castle in the sky.

Yo, I wrote this in Haiti, overlooking Cuba
I asked her what's her name, she said, 'Guantanamera'
Remind me of an old latin song, my uncle used to play
On his old forty-five when he used to be alive
She went from a young girl, to a grown woman
Like a Virgin, so she sex with no average mahn
Peep the figure, move like a caterpillar
Fly like a butterfly, let your soul feel her glide

A dime if you tell me that you love me

Make stakes at a faster rate then she fornicates
Pure traits of genius, Goddess of Black Venus
Crab niggaz angry cause they can't get between us
to no sele-xion, smooth complex-ion
The lexicon of Lexington, parents came from Cuba
Part Mexican, pure sweet, dimes fell to her feet
She like Movado, and shook her hips like Delgado
And broke niggaz down from the Grounds to Apollo
and then some, she took her act sent it to dim sum
And waited patiently while the businessmen come
Call late on purpose, got even politicians nervous
And made plans to infiltrate the street secret service
This gentle flower, fertility was her power
Sweet persona, Venus Flytrap primadonna
Que sera que sera she turned dinero to dinera

And we'll stir the stars around
And watch them fall away into the Hudson Bay
And plummet out of sight and sound

The open summer breeze will sweep you through the hills
Where I live in the Alpine Heights
Below the Northern Lights, I spend my coldest nights
Alone, awake, and thinking of
The weekend we were in love



Home among these mountaintops can be so awfully dull
A thousand miles from the tide
But photos on the walls of New York shopping malls
Distract me so I stay inside

I wish the rockets stayed over the Promenade
'Cause I would make a hook and eye
And fish them from the sky, my darling, she and I
We're hanging on so take us high
To sing the world goodbye

I am floating away
Lost in a silent ballet
I'm dreaming you're out in the blue
And I am right beside you
Awake to take in the view

Late nights and early parades
Still photos and noisy arcades
My darling we're both on the wing
Look down and keep on singing
And we can go anywhere

Are you there?

Are you there?

Or are you just a decoy dream in my head?
Am I home or am I simply tumbling all alone?

I am floating away 
Lost in a silent ballet 
I'm dreaming you're out in the blue
And I am right beside you

Broke-down and hungry
And too tired to moan

Then I heard somebody calling my name
Saying ain't no need to be shamed
I found out that the door was always open

I was trapped in my mind
A prisoner of my own design
Lost in a world
A world of confusion

I was there by myself
Couldn't find no help no where else
Thought I'd call up the hotline
But there was nobody there

A great masquerade

Aseptic floors
Colorful shelves: myriads of products, but all their content is the same
Fooled and deceived

Who made us swallow the bait that we need all that shit?
Place your blind faith
In every produce
Don't hesitate or enquire, just follow our rules
No one complains
Customer is king
Why would you bother, just enter the pin
Who made us fall
Fall for the myth
That we would be better off with everything at our fingertips?
No one realized
How somewhere along the line
We have surrendered to the great void in our lives
Overwhelmed by the immense selection
Exerted to cover our inanition
Afraid that there's something that we could be missing

Wit the mic in your throat and a jock for a gag
You're out of here, over, finished, all in
And Marly marl can't save you from fallin
'Cause as soon as you came back what did you do
To the break of dawn, another dumb move
You can't go hard, you're just so-so Todd
I'm that type of guy, oh my God
It's gets no rougher comes no weaker
marly hooked the beats so now you need a
Writer to bring you back from hell
Because I'm a rock up L
Low life loser, life like luna
Lafidasical, lispless luna
Tic liver lifeless, living likeness
Lusting longing lyrics like this
Little league, lard larsonist liar
Label ledger, left the leper liar
Bull, lull, lateral learning
Laps language latent lurking
Language, language, local logo
Light laboring, limited local
Now LL's a laughing stock
'Cause I bit that ass to the last stop
I watched you fall like Hitler fell
And now you're down to a broken L
You're records ain't hot and you're shows don't sell
Yo, tell 'em how you fell L, hard as hell
You came back and you thought you had me
But think about it, whos' your daddy

Kill 'em... Big daddy, I don't want none...
I did 'em wit a death blow

Ever since I lost you

Got nobody.. got no nothin to lose
I'm gonna get dressed up and go downtown
Spread a little misery round
Anything's better than feelin the blues

Found a restaurant on my way
Told 'em it was my birthday
Just to hear the waiters sing off-key
I've sprung a loose wire.. that's a fact
Got a strange little monkey on my back
But I kinda like the company.. and I guess

Hey, it's all right

Dance the little monkey around

We hid the truth beneath our skin but
Our shadows never looked the same

A ghost is all that's left 
Of everything we swore we never would forget
We tried to bleed the sickness, but we drained our hearts instead
We are, we are the dead

And when we couldn't stop the bleeding
We held our hearts over the flame
We couldn't help but call it treason
After that we couldn't fill our frames
After that our shadows never looked the same

Of everything we swore we never would forget
We tried to bleed the sickness, but we drained our hearts instead

With higher pitch and perfect aim 
And standing fast, we'd radiate
A light we loved but never named
But the answers never came

At the age of twenty-two

They took her body in a coffin
To a tiny church in Liege
Where she sprang up from the coffin
Just after the Agnus Dei

She soared up to the rafters
Perched on a beam up there
Cried ""The stink of human sin
Is more that I can bear""

Christina the Astonishing
Was the most astonishing of all
She prayed balanced on a hurdle
Or curled up into a ball

She fled to remote places
Climbed towers and trees and walls
To escape the stench of human corruption
Into an oven she did crawl

O Christina the Astonishing
Behaved in a terrifying way
She would run wildly through the streets
Jump in the Meusse and swim away

The emptiness when you were gone
Kept ringing in my head, 
Told myself I really had to move along,
Stop regretting all the things I left unsaid.

So I tore up your letters,
Took your picture off the wall.
I deleted your number,
It was too hard not to call.
And then I told myself that I would be fine
Gotta live for the good times.

'Cause everywhere I go there's a love song that reminds me of you,
And even though I knew I had to be strong I'm still not over you
'Cause I still believe and could see how there's nothing left of you and me.
Our time is over,
But I'm so not over you.

All my friends tried to tell me
That I'd find somebody new.
Why waste time being lonely,
When there's nothing left to loose.
Anything to get you out of my mind.
I'm a fool if I thought I could forget,
And I could not forget.

'Cause everywhere I go there's a love song that reminds me of you,
And even though I knew I had to be strong I'm still not over you
'Cause I still believe and could see how there's nothing left of you and me.
Our time is over.
But I'm so not over you.

Now I found a way to keep you there beside me,
To where my love for you cannot be denied.
I can only hope to keep you there to guide me,
There's no more need to hide from all this pain inside.

'Cause everywhere I go there's a love song that reminds me of you,
And even though I knew I had to be strong I'm still not over you.
'Cause I still believe and could see how there's nothing left of you and me.

It's getting sometimes I don't know 
When to stop when to go 
Sometimes we're so afraid to let it show 
A stolen kiss so out of place 
It wipes the smile right off your face 
And when those feelings start 
We let them go, let them go

Can you take before your heart breaks?

How can I say get away

Verse One: Parrish Smith

Ka-rank the boombox as my sound knock from blocks

To hell with the bitches and the so-called fame (uh-huh)

Bustin ass daily as I compose like Mozart
Just stand, say you're mad damn, why him?
Z-oh-one Tonka, five-sixty Benz
I'm sick and mad deep no shorts and no sleep
I'm bugged like a tapped phone, hard like concrete
So get a GRIP and don't SLIP or catch a CLIP

Should I try and forget?

Or, should I try and make it last?

Behind the mask, the demon resides
The meat was stripped from their bones

We destroy!

Burn it all down
Put them back underground 
This is a day that I promise
You will not forget

With the heart of a warrior, 
I rise with all I have left

I watched as the walls crumbled backed 
Backed with a burning sky, legions fell
They left with a mission complete
Genocide fulfilled; leave me for dead

Throw on a Gucci blazer and a Gucci tie 
Not a hair out of place,a freshly-shaved face 
You think you're walkin' out the house with style and grace 
(Don't you) 
You pick up your girl and take her to dinner 
'Cause when the night is over you think you're gonna win her 
Then you move real close using all your charm 
And then your girl says ""Baby guess that""

That odor,it's ringin' out loud and clear as a bell 
You can't hear it because you're immune to the smell 
I describe your aroma as foul and pathetic 
And they can use your odor as the latest anesthetic 
Now I know that it's stone cold funk,I can tell 
'Cause it's written all over by the way you smell 
That funk the aroma,that smell,that scent 
You'll be arrested for malicious body odor intent 
Your odor going 'round,doin' people bodily harm

Don't think I'm gonna wash my underarms this time 
The more you ignore,the worse the smell grows 
And you pick out all clothes by using your nose 
It was the rush hour when I was on the train 
And the smell of underarms was drivin' me insane 
It was a sure-fire way of bringing me to my death 
I couldn't hold a conversation,I was holding my breath 
And you cold see the funk just like a cloud in the air 
Was homeboy sittin' next to me,I swear! 
And when I saw the direction this girl was leaning 
You could hear homebody's underarms just screaming

Sippin' on a bottle of Dom Perignon 
The crowd was on the floor,rocking the beat 
Smelling like thay ain't bathed since last week 
The smell was all through the house,cold rockin' the place 
The funk fill the air like a fresh can of Mace 
When you raised your hands I had to sound tha alarm 
A girl said ""Look,there's Monster growin under his arm"" 
We were so shocked we couldn't even run (uhgh) 
And they declared  his arm public enemy number one 
Now throw your hands in the air,if you want to party hard 
Now put your hands back down,everybody's,'cause

More menace and I'll wreck the whole damn set
Smash (yes) you ain't seen *shit* yet
Yes, a fact, a black nine mil is what I pack
In the front of my waist, right next to my bozack
A safety, for the suckers that hate me
I haven't had to bust a couple of rounds lately
I hope not, it's no fun getting shot
Cause when I cock, I aim straight for the knot
I don't miss, I have a scope, no jokin
You should hope, that disco appearance like broke
Mass destruction when I start crushin and bustin
Duck MC's, I'm bumrushin
Swift wit the trig, there's nuff foes equipped
Real deal, of course, I pack steel, shit's thick
I'm not dumb, to walk the streets, they kept us swinging by
A punk chump wit spunk, who dares to jump
By the hour, I push power like Hiroshima
Got dropped on by USA and like cleaned her
I manage to damage people without a sequel
This is for my people

Verse Two: PMD

Check out the main attraction, black man in action
Number one crowd mover, I break backs in
Boy, you shoulda known what EPMD stands for
Sucker snappin necks, bustin caps, and breakin jaws
It's Erick and Parrish Making Dollars
Excel, living well, taking no shorts and why bother
to whine while I dine, sounds genuine
You walked in wrong camp, punk, stepped on a landmine
Boom bang, bust the slang that I bring
From Brentwood, Long Island, all the way to Sing-Sing
Yes the penile, peace to brothers on trial
For some *bullshit* charge, mugshot on file
For hard time, thump beats like an Alpine
No Sam Suey sole shoe shoot joints, back a tech nine
Yes the brother's back wit no knife or ax
Just a microphone, sucker, it limits that pack
Def blows and flows, quadraverbs and echoes
Sounds the pound hard to make an MC petrol
My nine mil, kitted wit the infrared beam
Something similar to a Roger Moore scene
That's James Bond, 007, wit guillotine
To keep the Hit Squad hype to fly heads like the A-Team
Don't bug or miss, bug on the sequel

And she said you were in town
Suddenly the memories came back to me
In my mind

How can I be strong?
I've asked myself
Time and time I've said
That I'll never fall in love with you again

A wounded heart you gave
My soul you took away
Good intentions you had many
I know you did

I come from a place that hurts
And God knows how I've cried
And I never want to return
Never fall again

Making love to you felt so good
And oh so right

How can I be strong?
I've asked myself
Time and time I've said
That I'll never fall in love with you again

So here we are alone again
Didn't think it'd come to this
And to know it all began
With just a little kiss

I've come too close to happiness
To have it swept away
Don't think I can take the pain
Never fall again

Kinda late in the game
And my heart is in your hands
Don't you stand there and then tell me
You love me, then leave again
'Cause I'm falling in love with you again

Hold me, hold me
Don't ever let me go
Say it just one time
Say you love me
God knows I do love you again",R&B,sad,1993

I wanna know that she'll be coming

She's coming, 
She's coming here to me,

desiring to kiss her now, 
I'm living for her,
breathing for her, 
singing for her fairytale.

And she was old and gray
She had her rusty strings and keys
And the tuner, it took a pair of pliers 
And lots of elbow grease
She awakened me to the melody 
Like the light from a brand new dawn
And from that moment on
It was all for the sake of the song

Her name was Maggie
She had eyes like fire
That burned for me in the dark
And all she wanted was my very soul 
And all she could take from my heart
But to her dismay a choice was made
And when the deed was done
She turned and I was gone
It was all for the sake of the song

And for the sake of the song
I walk my own road
For the sake of the song
Not for silver and gold
Some may think that I am wrong
But in my heart I know
And I've known all along
It was all for the sake of the song

Her name was Laura
She was pure like crystal
Shining alone on the shelf
And from the moment that her eyes met mine
I knew there could be nobody else
Kindred souls singing free in perfect harmony
Two hearts now beat as one
The road goes on and on
And it's all for the sake of the song

TRBGXHJ128F93302C7.h5,FFH,Listen,"Voices are everywhere, and they're screaming at us: use me, buy me, believe me.  We've got voices all over our culture: chat rooms, commercials, billboards, and bumper stickers, and they all want our immediate attention.

And then there is that voice from the past or that voice in your head that says you messed up too many times.  You can't do it.  You can't do it on your own.  You're not smart enough.  You're not strong enough.  You're not stable enough.  You're not thin enough.  And then there's the enemy.  The father of lies that likes to get in there and say no way you'll ever make anything of yourself.

I had this amazing conversation with my dad not too long ago.  He's a great man.  I love him so much.  And he told me about the first time that his father said something encouraging to him.  My dad had just put a room onto his house.  And my grandfather was a master carpenter and he was inspecting my dad's work.  And he got done and went to my dad, and said, ""That's a good job Harry.""  And that was the first time my grandfather said something encouraging to my dad, and he was 38 years old.

Man, and without hearing that voice.  Without hearing that, whether it's the actually the physical audible voice of your father or mother, or the voice from God, you don't have any identity.  You have no way to function.  I think Jesus knew that.  I think that's why, when He went through His ministry, touching people and healing people, and speaking to people.  He never asked them to be anything that they weren't.  He tried to get them to understand who they were.  That's why he said, ""You're my daughter, you're my son, you're my brother, you're my sheep.""  He wanted us to identify with Him and understand that we're His creation; that we're worth something.



Yeah, and that's something amazing about Jesus.  He could look down into somebody's spirit and draw out who they really were.  I mean, he looked at Simon and said, ""You know what?  You're not Simon, You're Peter.  You're a Rock.""

And how 'bout that woman that came up to Him when He was going through that crowd, and she touched His garment, and he turned around and he said, ""Daughter.""  His first word: Daughter. 

You know, Jesus got that honestly from His father.  Three times when Jesus was under immense pressure in his ministry, God the father actually spoke.  I mean, spoke audibly, It wasn't inward.  Jesus heard it, and the people around Jesus heard it.  Like at His baptism, God the father said, ""you are my son, I love you and I'm pleased with you.""  And then at the transfiguration, the father spoke again and the disciples heard it.  The father said, ""You are my son.  I have chosen you, and God just established Christ's purpose on that mountain.""  And then, before Christ died at Gethsemane in John 12, Jesus prayed: should I pray to be delivered from this hour?  No.  This is why I've come.  Glorify your name father.  And the father spoke and said, ""I have glorified it, and I will glorify it again.""  And I think that promise just drove Christ to the cross.  

I think it did too.  You may have never heard that voice.  That voice that says you're worth it.  You're smart enough.  I believe in you.  I love you.  There may be a gaping hole in your spirit where that voice was supposed to speak into, and it's just a vacuum.  Listen, Jesus doesn't require anything of you.  You can't work to get His approval.  Remember, when he was affirmed by His father, when God looked down and said, ""This is my son who I love.""  Jesus hadn't done a single miracle.  All he asks of you is that you listen.",Christian,sad,2005

Left school when I was still a child,
Hit the streets and started running wild.
Hanging out in the neighborhood,
People said, ""They're up to no good!""
Never thought I'd ever make it through,
Hey boy, what you gonna do?

Crosstown traffic, sirens wailing, screaming in my ear.
It's got me on the run, gotta move on out of here.

I'm on a dead end street, on a dead end street,
Well it's got me beat, on a dead end street.
I can't go no further, won't somebody rescue me,
From this dead end street, oh yeah.

They still talk about the big fight,
On the backstreet at midnight.
Everybody heard the gunfire,
Saw him dragged into the Black Maria.
Now my best friend is doing time,
He's committed to a life of crime.
Got a feeling I'll be next in line,
I wonder how can I get out in time?

I stepped into a movie, this can't be reality.
If I wasn't so lucky, I wonder where I'd be?

I'm on a dead end street, on a dead end street,
Well it's got me beat, on a dead end street.
I can't go no further, won't somebody rescue me,
From this dead end street, oh yeah.

{Rod - Slide Solo}

Crosstown traffic, sirens wailing, screaming in my ear.
It's got me on the run, gotta move on outta here.

I'm on a dead end street, on a dead end street,
Well it's got me beat, on a dead end street.
It's got me walking, it's got me talking,
I'm on a dead end street, I'm on a dead end street.

Scoping lightning from his pores
Keeping time, with his hurricane beat

Do it breathe? Do it got a heartbeat? Is it alive?
Do it leave, only to become a star in the sky?

If only for now until the next time I body a track
From the first clap I hurt rap, now watch the earth crack
Bring the hearse back, and take a lyrical dirt nap
I roll with the hardest niggas, make money with the smartest niggas

Better shut your trap before you become a target nigga

How hard the path is trodden
From when horsepower meant what it said

I've got a hundred horses hidden in between my wheels
But i can't put my foot down and jumped the fences in the field
Patiently waiting to get their old jobs back

How easily forgotten,
How easily we're led
How hard the path is trodden
From when horsepower meant what it said

And if we're keeping up with progress why am i standing still
Maybe we should take a walk and talk to the horses on the hill

How easily we're led
How hard the path is trodden
From when horsepower meant what it said

Who complains about what he is owed?
And throw a tantrum like he is three years old

Bottle after bottle 'till we got messed up

TRBIGGV12903CABC77.h5,4Him,Strange Way To Save The World,"I'm sure he must have been surprised
At where this road had taken him
Cause never in a million lives
Would he have dreamed of Bethlehem

CHANNEL
And standing at the manger
He saw with his own eyes
The message from the angel come to life
And Joseph said

CHORUS
Why me, I'm just a simple man of trade
Why Him with all the rulers in the world
Why here inside this stable filled with hay
Why her, she's just an ordinary girl
Now I'm not one to second guess
What angels have to say
But this is such a strange way to save the
World

To think of how it could have been
If Jesus had come as He deserved
There would have been no Bethlehem
No lowly shepherds at His birth

CHANNEL
But Joseph knew the
Reason love had to reach so far
And as he held the Savior in his arms
He must have thought

REPEAT CHORUS

Now, I'm not one to second guess
What angels have to say
But this is such a strange
Way to save the world
Such a strange way, this is
Such a strange way
A strange way to save the world
A strange way to save the world",Christian,happy,2000
TRBIGRU128F145B139.h5,Alias,Standing In The Darkness,"Ten times before it divided you
Ten years ago to this very day
Hello, I wish you well
There's no response, no companions here
Can't read the signs or between the lines
Goodbye, I wish you well

Now where are we going
I don't know and I don't even care

I'm running through the night
Searching in the shadows
Looking for the light
Running through the night
Searching in the shadows
Going for the light
Standing in the darkness
Its all a glow I cant see the stars
Fourth of July in the summertime
And now its time to sail
Caught in the act now you watch my back
Can't tell a lie I'm afraid to die
Goodbye I wish you well
Now where are we going
I don't know and I don't even care",Electronic,happy,1990

We have seen some
suffering baby
It has not always been perfect

After all this time

Darling we know it
Whatever may come
We can get through it
As if its just begun
Oh its just begun

Its all about our love

TRBIIEU128F9307C88.h5,New Found Glory,Don't Let Her Pull You Down,"It's time that I rain on your parade
Watch as all your hopes explode from landmines
You ask for help but people turn away
You're living so far away from the truth
That you're believing in your own lies
It's no surprise that you sleep at night, drowning in your prize

You made him feel so welcome (welcome)
Make him forget about the poison running through his veins
You may say that you love him (love him)
Now lie in the mess you've made

(Don't let her!)
Don't let her pull you down
(Don't let her!)
Don't let her pull you down
(Don't let her!)
Don't let her pull you down

It's time I get a few things straight with you
You haven't been in for the whole time
Your stories, like your lifestyle, distorted, yeah
You're living so far away from the truth
That you're leaving me with no choice
To put you back in your place with every sentence

You made him feel so wanted (wanted)
You make him feel that there is nothing more beyond your door
You may say that you love him (love him)
Now tell me what the rush is for

(Don't let her!)
Don't let her pull you down
(Don't let her!)
Don't let her pull you down
(Don't let her!)
Don't let her pull you down
(Don't let her!)

I hope that, this isn't a sign of things to come (things to come)
I'll kill myself for blaming you (blaming you)
Please tell me now, is this a sign of things to come?

(Don't let her!)
Don't let her pull you down
(Don't let her!)
Don't let her pull you down

Don't let her pull you down

Look who just walked in
He knows just where to find me
Here we go again
I can tell he's gonna ask me to dance
Thats not as far as he wants to go
I need ten thousand angels
To help me tell him no

Chorus:
Lead me not into temptation
Heaven help me to be strong
I can fight all that I'm feelin
But I can't do it alone
Help me break this spell that I'm under
Guide my feet and hold me tight
I need ten thousand angels
watchin over me tonight

It's time to face my weakness
Look him in the eye
Lord knows it wont be easy
but I've just gotta try
I cant let myself get lost in his arms
Thats how i got my heart broke before
I need ten thousand angels
To walk me out the door

Repeat Chorus

I need ten thousand angels 
Watchin over me tonight

Ten thousand angels watchin over me tonight

TRBIIOT128F423C594.h5,Joy Division,Leaders Of Men,"Born from some mother's womb
Just like any other room
Made a promise for a new life
Made a victim out of your life

When your time's on the door
And it drips to the floor
And you feel you can touch
All the noise is too much
And the seeds that are sown
Are no longer your own

Just a minor operation
To force a final ultimatum
Thousand words are spoken loud
Reach the dumb to fool the crowd

When you walk down the street
And the sound's not so sweet
And you wish you could hide
Maybe go for a ride
To some peep show arcade
Where the future's not made

A nightmare situation
Infiltrate imagination
Smacks of past Holy wars
By the wall with broken laws

The leaders of men
Born out of your frustration
The leaders of men
Just a strange infatuation
The leaders of men
Made a promise for a new life
No saviour for our sakes
To twist the internees of hate
Self induced manipulation
To crush all thoughts of mass salvation",Rock,sad,1978
TRBIJYB128F14AE326.h5,Seventh Day Slumber,Shattered Life,"This wanting more from me is tearing me, it's breaking me
But what you want's not mine to give
I'm your dollar sign, your brand new house,
Your product line
When you're done with me I'm spent.
When the smoke is gone I have to face what I've become...

Chorus:
Will you rescue me? Could you get me out alive?
I'm trying to hold on but I've lost the will to fight
Will You rescue me? Take me far away from this shattered life.

How can I go on pretending that there's nothing wrong?
Life has brought me to my knees
This mask I hide behind is killing me,
There's nothing left
Is there anyone who feels like me?
When the smoke is gone I have to face what I've become...

(Chorus)",Rock,sad,2005
